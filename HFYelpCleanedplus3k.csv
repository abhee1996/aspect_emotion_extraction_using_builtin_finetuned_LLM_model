There were two ladies waiting ahead of us I thought they were waiting for other people, we waited about five minutes there before they were seated and there were plenty of seats. The hostess came back and then walked back again into the kitchen area for the second time without a word to us, we waited another seven minutes, I said I was going to count this, and no one ever came to seat us. A gentleman came to the greeting podium ignored us, so we left. I called to ask to speak to the manager and was told they were busy, so I reported what happened to us to the person that answered the phone and they said, OK. No apology. Nothing. We've been going to this Red Lobster since the 70's. My husband worked there when they were on the west side of Moller Rd when we were in high school. I'll never go back. It's sad whet is happening to the west side of Indy. This is what happens when you hire mannerless, low quality people."

We were greeted upon entering with a short five minute wait.   It was much longer to sit on the patio.  We opted for the bar area. I wish we would have been given a bar menu instead of just dinner menus as I would have liked a smaller meal.  Our waiter seemed overwhelmed with bar tables and took some time to finally take our food orders.   He was nice and polite but just seemed overworked.   We both ordered cheeseburgers with tater tots.  
Meal was decent but we probably would not come back.   The place is in a strip, typical chain house menu, and nothing special that would make us return with all the other restaurants in the area."

This JItB used to be the ""one"" we would always avoid mainly because it took forever to get your food and it was always just lackluster when you finally got it. (I know some people are rolling their eyes thinking, yeah that is what fast food is.)

Recently they went through a remodel and maybe a management change. The new interior is really Nice and allot cleaner than it was previously. 

I actually dropped in here because the JItB on Washington had been crappy the last few times I went. But here both the drive through and walk in we're fast and the people were friendly. 

Once I got home with the goods my wife and I opened our burger wrappers and lets just say you don't see a fast food burger put together this well very often. Also the taste of the burger was incredible. They must be actually spicing the patties now or something. Also the curly fries were not fried to a crisp and all little shards. We have been back a couple of times and they have been really consistent, so whatever the change was with the food we are liking it Jack!"

Excellent customer service. Polite delivery team. Pies always delivered within their promised window and in PERFECT condition. It's so easy to write a review SLAMMING folks for poor service or quality - I wanted to make a point of taking the time to sing their praises. Too tired to cook? Live within the delivery zone? (I'm Old City - they're So. Philly) Call the team on Girard Avenue!

Because I keep buying plants because something happens to them. Or I just have a black thumb. I usually pick a few herbs during a sale and pick a few veggie plants for the garden box. The peony from last year grew back this year. I wanted another one, but didn't see it today. I picked up a hydrangea plant instead. Will see if it comes back next year. This location has a better selection of garden stuff than the south location. 

I also like coming here for my DIY projects when one comes to mind. There is a lot you can do with pvc pipes and magnet stuff. 

If you plan to buy a large quantity of something heavy like bricks, you can call ahead and they will pick it and load it on a cart for you, so you will only have to load the car. 

Staff is always friendly to me and my furbaby. They have treats too!"

We wanted a refund - after some hassle and rudeness from the staff - we finally got one and they came to pick up the pizza - but ended up paying $5 (tip) that they ""couldn't"" refund even though we paid that prior to knowing the pizza that was delivered was inedible.  We paid $5 to almost be poisoned.   

But at work - my coworker and I thought we would give it another go at lunch time instead.  I wish we could attach pictures.  We got the sliders.  Most of which are burnt.  I'm glad I paid the extra $1 something for extra cheese on three of them because the ones I trusted to have regular cheese are barely covered in it.  The pepperoni we ordered looks like it was put on after the pizza was cooked.  

Shame on me for giving them another chance.  Shame on them for thinking what they spew out is food."

There is an obvious difference between this franchisee Starbucks and other company owned Starbucks. They never have all the same pastries, wraps and salads that you'll find at a company owned Starbucks. They also receive limited quantities for seasonal drink additives so when they run out, they run out and they aren't able to restock.

Getting a consistent drink here is really hit or miss. The Associates here are not trained like Starbucks Baristas; so one day they may be stocking, one day they may be cashiers and the next day they may be here at the Starbucks counter. Over the past year I've become familiar with at least two ladies that work here often and when I come for an afternoon run and they are extremely helpful. I no longer have to state how many pumps of toffee-nut or mocha I would like in my drink (keep in mind you never have to do that at a company owned store because they are trained on proper usage and only deviate per customer requests). This location has lots of the regular Starbucks swag and seasonal coffee. Now you can get the 10-cent discount on your drink purchase when you bring in a travel coffee mug.  All in all, in a pinch and needing a legal addictive stimulant - this place will do."

It's been weeks and I've tried to reach out to the store and I'm always put on hold. Then I reached out to Corporate and they told me that they reached out to the owner, with no response. All I want is my money back and they will NEVER be bothered with me again.
     This is not for all stores, just this one...Just unprofessional."

Want a made-to-order sub 24/7? They can do that. Want to order it on a computer so you can wander the store and not wait on a long line? Sure, they'll rock that. .99cent ATM? OK. 

Never been to Wawa? Imagine 7-11 and Subway merged together but improved their subs and the quality of, well, everything else. That my friends, is Wawa. 

The kicker would be if they sold beer."

It is busy, and it sounds like your on the market place. Love it! The menu is simple, but the food is not. It is packed so you might have to wait a bit. I had to wait, but they sent me a text message when the table is ready. I ordered the bacon, which actually tasted like a million dollar. The smoked salmon is of the hook-pun intended. 

Service is quick and friendly,and the kitchen is also doing a great job bringing out the many dishes people order to dine in, take out, or delivery. For sure one of the places in STL I will return too."

Upon rolling up, I still wasn't sure. It's basically a fixed-location food truck with some restrooms and outside/inside seating. 

Get a taco. They're great. I chose barbacoa, and everything was flavorful, fresh, and not a big old ball of grease, as is usually the case at Mexican food trucks.

My esteemed Yelp Miami fellow reviewer E-V-E had highly recommended the agua fresca, but I saw horchata on the menu and was immediately seduced. Mistake. I should have gone with the agua fresca. The horchata was oversweetened to the point of being cloying. It didn't have that nice gritty rice-y texture that I like, either. Oh well. Let this be a lesson, when someone gives you an emphatic recommendation, take it. 

Excellent cheap taco lunch, though. I'd definitely come back."

This place is a disgrace & should close or get an entire new staff.  After 10 minutes trying to order, they of course got the order wrong.  The girl taking the order, Darci - was totally clueless and only wanted to argue.  We tried to diffuse the situation, so asked for a manager.  Dorian - WHAT A JOKE?!?!  He was even worse that her!  Stay away from this place - we got our money back (but not the 20 minutes we wasted!) and went to the one at 16th & Arlington - a total night & day experience."

The only thing worse than waiting an extra 20 minutes on an order that was supposed to already be ready for pickup, is getting the order, and it's wrong... and then getting that stupid stoned look from the guy at the window that's absolutely clueless what to do.

I can honestly say I think I've had my last piece of Domino's pizza."

We always order delivery. The pizza and wings are always great and the delivery time is never too long. We normally get the same two girls that deliver our order and they are super friendly and personable! Their online ordering system is very easy and they always have some great deals going on.

Most of the time when I've come here the employees are very friendly and helpful. However, one time recently I dropped off a package with a prepaid shipping label that needed tape (only the second time in years that I've asked them for tape) and a man who I believe was the owner chastised me for not taping my own box and threatened to charge me for it. The amount of tape he used on this box probably cost him no more than ten cents. If he felt that charging me was appropriate then he should've just charged me for it. I wouldn't have faulted him for charging me for something that cost him money. However, chastising a grown adult because they don't own packing tape is ridiculous. 

In the future I will take my packages down the street to PostNet on Tanque Verde and Sabino. The employees there are friendly and treat customers with respect."

The theme was pretty cool, they did a nice job on that, but the food didn't fit the bill IMHO. Took wifey recently for Lunch and decided to try the Mushroom Swiss Burger with the truffle fries and Wifey went with the customized Burger cause she has to get special with it. 

I thought my Burger decent, maybe a 7.9 on a scale of 1 to 10. It just wasn't memorable, I was expecting it to blow me away, but it just wasn't all that and a bag of chips. The bill came to $46 and sone change for two people (ice tea included). 

Wifey had a different experience which I'll let her elaborate on herself. 

Im willing to give them another chance in the future. I can see myself going back to Fords Garage for drinks and appetizers. They are in a great location, and the service is pretty good."

We were there at Friday around 11:30, this place only 35% fill. These should be easy for them to serve us. By the time we walk out at 12:15 pm. The place is full. 

The lunch special is attractive. I saw the chicken chimichurri hash at lunch special menu is attractive. The dish serve in skillet with potatoes hash, grilled chicken, grilled onion and top with two egg of your choice. Sunny side up is definitely the best to break the egg yolk for the mixed of the hash. This dish also has the chimichurri sauce make this dish decorative. 

For the energy, I have morning meditation drink. It is orange, lemon, turmeric, ginger, agave nectar, and beet. What a drink and nice presentation. 

Service is a little let down at the end.  Food is good."

anyway, this one was pretty nice for a cfa. its spacious and has all the amenities you would ever want. they're pretty quick about ordering from the inside! I haven't yet been through the drive through but it seems pretty fast moving as well. your typical CFA menu: everything is DELICIOUS!! ! 1 bonus point for this location is that they leave their honey bbq sauce outside (near the ketchup condiments) so you can grab as much as u want! 

this cfa is located out in west nashville on charlotte pike, so if you're making the trek, make sure to gas up for cheap at costco or something before headed back to your side of the city."

But Jimmy's is open till 3am, and after years of nothing but pizza and pitas open that late in downtown Boise, a sandwich was a nice change of pace. The staff is very friendly and patient with drunk patrons. The deli pickles are enormous and perfectly crunchy. There are a wide range of sandwich options and tons of window seating for prime late-night people watching. I would certainly recommend stumbling into this establishment after a night of festive merry-making. 

There is, however, a 'no hippies welcome' sign. Perhaps management could be convinced to take this down?"

I had to travel to this Pizza Hut to get my fix of pizza hut pizza, which has been my favorite pizza since I was a kid. I was not disappointed. I ate in and ordered a pepperoni & sausage pan pizza and it came out pipping hot and had that wonderfully delicious taste that brings me back to my childhood. My mouth is watering right now thinking back on it. I ate as much as I could and packed up the rest for the next day. It seems like there was only one person working in the restaurant, but it wasn't crowded and she provided friendly service. I love Pizza Hut! I will be back!"

There's no delivery charge, and they'll text you with a delivery photo at the door...we didn't even notice anyone approaching the front porch.  We just saw a vehicle speeding away after receiving a text message. 

As for our food--Crab fries were somewhat soggy/wilted by the time they got delivered as some might well-expect it. They still tasted very good especially with the special white cheese sauce.  Roast beef sandwich was on point--very tasty and substantial--half was big enough for me to fill my appetite.  Crab bruschetta was good with fresh ingredients, and the balsamic vinaigrette glaze added a great flavor. 

Overall very good dining--delivery experience. Yes!!"

It's extremely unnerving to venture out with your mask to run errands and putting in your best effort to stay 6 feet apart only to be met with the woman behind the counter who is making your food, breathing all over it with a mask that is clearly just there out of looks and not even covering her nose. Then at check out she pulled it down completely to speak. I almost walked out 
This is completely unacceptable. As we were eating our food she was filling the drinks in the same manner. Picture included. I also don't want to call somebody out that might cost their job but ALL patrons should be warned this location is not a safe space.

Had lunch and a coffee that was fair. At least until they kicked me off the internet after only ONE HOUR!

Never in all the years I have gone to coffee shops/sandwich shops that offer free internet was I KICKED OFF because you only get one hour of surfing! Are you kidding me????? First of all, I purchased lunch AND coffee. Secondly, the place easily had 35-40% open tables. 

I decided to go one block away to the Starbucks. Yea, thats right. Starbucks is one block away on 1081 West Chester Pike in West Chester, PA 19382. Got a nice snack pack of fruit and cheese.

For about $5 you can have a large filling vegetarian burger with whopper sauce. Since I haven't eaten red meat in over 10 years I do still think it it taste very very similar to a regular whopper.

I have been a fan of Pizza Hut for about 20 years now. Today, I had the worst experience ever. Being a full time student and business owner, I have little time to cook. I've decided today to order from my favorite place. I ordered my food for delivery at 5:15 pm. After waiting 3 hours, I decided to give the restaurant a call to ensure everything was okay. The gentlemen who answered the phone, very unprofessional as if he was on his personal device, assured me that it would be delivered shortly. After another hour of waiting by my front door with my son, I decided to just cancel the order. I called the store and the female who answered informed my that I have not ordered since April 1st. After spending an upwards of ten minutes giving her reference numbers and personal information, I heard a gentlemen yelling in the background that there was not answer to my door or my cell phone, which I keep on my lap due to my business. I could tell in her voice that she knew something went wrong with the delivery and was told to lie. This was a very unprofessional experience."

I'm usually a big fan of the meatball sub, but today they really slopped on too much of the marinara sauce, and it really overwhelmed the sandwich.  I couldn't even finish it all.  It wasn't bad, just not as good as other times at other Subway stores.  Since this store is smack in the heart of the city, it's got a different set up than any other Subway stores I've been to in the county.  All the drinks, including the cooler and fountain drinks are behind the counter.  So, if you want a refill, you'd have to wait for them to finish serving someone else before you could get one.  All the ones I've been to in the county have the fountain drinks out in the seating area.  Just a minor inconvenience, but I'm sure it has something to do with the area.  I imagine they've had a problem a time or two with someone using it for a ""free"" drink.  All in all, my experience at this location was ok, but I'll only come here if I'm in the area."

I go to get a better meal than I could get somewhere like McDonald's or Taco Bell but for roughly the same price. It's all about convenience and this one delivers!

Food: My favorite menu item is the Meatball Marinara with lettuce, spinach and jalapeno. I also love their flatbread pizzas and sandwiches. However, I typically always order the salad because I know I can get a low-priced meal that's LOADED with veggies without all the calories. The Chopped Salad is great because the portion is typically SUPER HUGE and you don't get charged extra if you want a ton of veggies. Tell them you want a lot of veggies and they'll take you up on it! 

Drinks: Self-serve soda fountain.

Atmosphere: I usually take my food to go because I don't like smelling like Subway after eating there. Am I the only one who notices the after-smell that sticks to your clothes? 

Service: Fast and friendly. No complaints! 

Healthy Hack: The honey mustard sauce makes a great salad dressing because it's one of the lowest calorie options! Want to work on portions? Ask for any of the toppings on the side so you can control how much goes on top!

Tips: Ask for lots of veggies! There's no extra charge."

The  prices are definitely economical, and the family meal sizes are big enough to feed a hungry army. 

I came to this carrollwood location since I was in the area to pick up some food for the family on a Sunday. I like the varieties of meals there are to choose from, but when it came to picking the sides this time around it was a bit of a challenging process. I originally wanted green beans to go with the family meal sides, but instead they offered mac n cheese because they were out of the green beans. I was able to still get mashed potatoes and gravy, and the Cole slaw.  

I know it's a Sunday around dinner time, but it didn't quite make sense to me how they would be out of the green beans already. I settled for the mac and cheese this time, hoping it'll be good. I'm thinking it's probably the more popular chosen side option, but I still like my green beans. 

The restaurant appears to have a more expanded seating area,  which is a nice upgrade for the sit in experience if you do stay and eat rather than take out. All in all, I still enjoy the yummy goodness kfc has to offer."

There is ALWAYS a line of people who are incredulous as to how inefficient this post office is and how long the line wait is.  Why is this Post Office so inefficient, you ask? Because the ""employees"" answer to no one!  No one can get fired here.  They just look like they are busy (walking around with nothing in hand) or tell people that their register is closed or just appear out of nowhere and ask if anyone is picking up a package, otherwise they cannot help now.  They don't worry about helping the customer, because the Post Office is a monopoly.  Where are the customers going to go?  Nowhere because the next nearest post office is pretty far, and somewhat of a hassle to get to.

I was able to substitute a biscuit instead of the English muffin and even though the biscuit was huge, there was no upcharge. Those crab cakes! How were they so good in a landlocked state?! The poached eggs were perfect too. My husband had the carrot cake pancakes, and you know I had to try those too... I have to stop now, I'm currently drooling again."

As soon as our server came to the table, I knew we were in for a terrible night. She skipped all of the formalities (appetizers, special deals) and rudely asked us what we wanted to drink right off the bat. She treated us with strong disregard the entire night, and most likely assumed we couldn't pay for the meal because we look younger than we are. 

She seated us directly by the noisy kitchen to be monitored even though the place was almost empty. The 2 stars are for the food and the kind hostess.

I wasn't extremely upset about her treatment toward us until she seated people near us and asked them about appetizers and joked around with them. That's how I knew...

...this was age discrimination."

I have repeatedly had awful service from this place. Every employee (minus one; a blonde guy) does not say thank you, you're welcome, or even a HELLO when you walk in. 

As one particular man makes my sandwich, he proceeds to turn his head and sneeze. Not covering his face, bread door wide open, and sneezes! I couldn't believe what I saw. Again, today the same man is making my sandwich, then turns his head to the side and just starts to cough. The same exact situation. Am I surprised? Nope.

Again, the staff accommodated to my dietary restrictions which I was ever grateful.  The pizza had one tiny sliver of lobster shell.  The pizza dough or was it flatbread of some sort was delish.

Generally, I do enjoy their lunch sandwiches. I enjoy the soups. Occasionally we will take home some bagels and cream cheese, usually the sweeter bagels if we do. 

But I've never been loyal to them, or overly impressed for any reason. For some reason, whenever I think of Panera, overrated always pops into my mind. 

On a whim, I stopped in this location for breakfast. When I'm here, I usually drive past to go to Manhattan Bagel to get my breakfast sandwich. Today, I switched it up. 

So after a bacon, egg and cheese on a sesame bagel, and a large hazelnut coffee from Panera, I say it's not too bad. 

But I should have kept on driving. 

It wasn't that Panera was bad. It's just that for what I like, and for what I'm paying, Manhattan Bagel does that same sandwich much better, and even the coffee is better. 

Panera seems to smash the bagel sandwich in their sandwich maker to warm it up, when keeping the bagel intact and untouched is so much better. Panera coffee seemed to me to be slightly watered down. 

When competition 4 doors away does something better than you, what am I supposed to say? 

Panera is good, but will never be great. They look a lot better than what they are."

I really like their space taking brand Fried Chicken. This is a mild Cajun flavor Louisiana. Just to give it a different taste & a nice crunchy exterior & moist interior. I am also impressed with their new non- original flavor of plain fried chicken.

I put their biscuits second to Hardee's, which in my opinion are the best in town. Red beans and rice is something I've just grown up on & I love them.  There flavoring is always spot on. So many places have trouble cooking rice, but it is always cooked perfectly. LOL, they have the secret down. Try it.....you will be hooked. Their prices are very good also, in my opinion.

Dirty Dining: Kentucky Fried Chicken temporarily closed after live roaches seen in the kitchen

On-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with Colonel Sanders' 'Original Recipe' may have had some extra ingredients put in after inspectors found live roaches crawling near their food.

Our ABC Action News I-Team uncovering that state inspectors shut down the Kentucky Fried Chicken at 3102 E. College Avenue on Friday September 23 after seeing 18 live and dead roaches near the prep table, ice machine, hot holding units, fountain machine.

They also found roach droppings on a hole in the wall behind the prep table in this Ruskin KFC location.  

In addition, other violations documented include:  Salad at 47-degrees in the reach-in cooler when it should be at 41-degrees or colder, employees not washing their hands, equipment in poor repair and floor tiles cracked, broken or in disrepair.  


KFC Statement:

Following the health inspection on Friday, the restaurant repaired structural issues, and underwent cleaning, as well as inspection and treatment from a licensed pest control provider. The restaurant was given permission from the health department to reopen on Saturday morning. All of our restaurants are required to follow strict operating standards, and we will continue to work with the franchisee who owns this location to be sure it meets those standards going forward.

Free peanuts is great, large mugs of beer is really nice, and it's a hat trick when you're not seated around wailing children.  Standard chain restaurant: mediocre but acceptable starters and entrees; middle shelf beer and wine choices; cocktail offerings that make you think a fruit juice factory exploded; and staff who can barely give enough of a damn to pay attention.

Here's my real complaint.  I ordered a ribeye, rare.  I got a thin slice of steak that was just gray enough on the outside to qualify as done and probably medium rare if you turn the lights down.  I pointed out to the server that there was no color to the outside of the steak, and he explains to me that you can't cook a steak that thin rare and get color on it.  First, yes.  You can.  Second, don't lecture me on how a steak is prepared.  Your job is to bring it to me.  Third, if the people in the back can't cook a steak to proper doneness without cooking it well, that's OK, but don't call yourself TEXAS Roadhouse.  Texans know how to cook meat.  This place knows how to warm it.

Go if you're hungry and it's the quickest place to sit down.  Be sure you get you money's worth by eating at least 3 pounds of peanuts."

Although we were seated immediately, our service was inexcusable and I was very disappointed and let down. 

Evan T took over ten minutes just to take our drink orders and over twenty for the two alcoholic drinks to arrive. I had to ask four times just to receive more bread that should be automatic.

When our food finally arrived at the table, we were missing the fruit for our child's meal, one of the prime rib dinners was GRILLED well done instead of medium, the other prime rib was medium rare instead of medium and was missing rice, and the the outback special came well done instead of medium rare.  

We spoke to the manager and received the proper meals. She later took off only the appetizer and apologized.  

In addition, the bench seating was extremely uncomfortable and the ladies restroom was well overdue for a cleaning.

Here's hoping they'll improve and soon in the near future. Until that time, THIS Outback Steakhouse has lost my business."

Moving to the Alton area from the big city of STL, the first thing I noticed on entering this Home Depot was the cleanliness. The HD close to my home was always kinda grungy and unkept. This one is kept fairly clean and well organized. 

The next thing that surprised me was the customer service. The associates here, actually approach you and ask if you need assistance. They don't avoid eye contact when you meet them in an aisle. The ones who have assisted me thus far have been knowledgeable in their given area. 

A new feature that I've learned to take advantage of at this location, is ordering items on line that are available at this location and having them shipped to the customer service counter for pick-up. Damn, this makes life so much easier.

I'm a happy girl with Dominio's! I don't see one thing wrong here. Except the fact their food is incredibly fattening! Come on! It's pizza! and pizza-related items. And even though pizza is the perfect food, we all know it's not that great for you! So what? Sometimes ya just have to go for it!

Chicken Bacon-Tomato Bites! Omg, these are simply delectable! What IS THIS? It is chunks of very lean grilled, skewered chicken, topped with a deeply garlicky sauce, a melted combo of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, topped with fresh tomatoes, and very crisp, lean bacon. It's so rich and deliciously tender! Get this!

I also shared the traditional breadsticks with my sweetie, even though there are about 5 other kinds. Perfect with the complimentary spicy marina sauce.

There certainly are a lot of new items on Dominio's menu, which just goes to show you how long it's been since we had it.

We placed our order online and it was delivered piping hot within 20 minutes with good service and a smile.

You can't get any better than that!

Parking was adequate, although I'm not sure how it is when the place is busy. The restrooms and dining area were clean, as far as I could tell.

I had a few issues with this particular Burger King though. Firstly, they don't give courtesy cups for water, even if you're buying food.  If I don't want the soda, it seems like such a waste to buy bottled water when I could've gotten water from the water spigot at the soda fountain. Secondly, there were no condiment packets in the dining area other than salt and pepper. Seems like management has gone to some lengths to prevent people from helping themselves to complimentary amenities, which is fine if they want to minimize loss, but it also means that I probably won't be back."

It only took a few minutes to book the rental online and they called a day ahead to confirm my reservation as well as let us know what documents would be required to secure the rental.

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and promptly provided keys. Trey assisted us with picking up and inspecting the rental vehicle upon return. He was so pleasant, polite, knowledgeable, and eager to assist. He was our first impression of Southern hospitality and really got our vacation off to a great start. I liked that after returning the vehicle, we were asked if we needed a ride anywhere and they were so kind as to deliver us back to the airport. Trey also asked how we felt about their customer service before we left which I found to be a nice touch from Enterprise.

I would have given 5 stars but the vehicle we rented was pretty dirty / in need of a wash on the exterior , although the interior was clean and it had a 14 inch crack in the driver's side of the front windshield which Trey asked  whether would be too distracting to drive. While I appreciated him acknowledging the giant crack and gaining manager approval to offer a discount because of it, I don't think a vehicle with such a huge crack in the windshield should remain part of rental inventory at all. On this day, it was also the only available vehicle of its class and capacity so we went with it."

The employees seemed happy to be at work, the food was fresh and well made, service came with a smile and warm greetings, and it was always an all around pleasant experience. 

A couple of weeks ago there was a change in management, and the new manager (Amber) has really changed the place for the worse. Days she's there, the employees are noticeably less happy than days she isn't. The food isn't as fresh. Customers are just treated as customers and there is less of a ""homey"" or ""welcoming"" feeling. 

There's nothing particularly exceptional about Panera of West Chester anymore, and that makes me sad.  This used to be one of my favorite establishments, but no longer."

The waitress came by to apologize to them and promised they'd get that one and another one free to take home.

After long delays they finally opened in December. We went opening night, but it was so busy we decided to leave and come back the next day. Well that got fucked real quick. The very next day they had a kitchen fire, and they were closed again for almost 6 months. So this week they finally reopened. This location is super convenient, since it's along our shopping route. We went for mid-afternoon visit, which was smart since there was no wait. That was a plus. The order is made fresh.  
I will say I didn't have high hopes since it's not the full menu like the 
Steak n' Shakes mostly everywhere else, but I was happily disappointed because it was excellent. 

My triple with cheese was fantastic, the fries were thin and perfectly crisp. I also tried the prime steak Burger which is their bigger Burger but it didn't seem bigger and it definitely didn't have the same good juicy flavor as the double or the triple burgers. 

Next time, I'll have to try the shake to make sure it's as good as the shakes I've had down south.I am up by here weekly so that will be real soon.

So happy it's finally here and they're open. Please don't have another fire I can't go through that again. Viva la burgers !!!"

I remember having Los Agaves mole at the other location. Mole is a sauce of complexity that makes your tastebuds dance. I'm always in on delicious mole since making it myself would mean 20+ ingredients. Someday I will make mole...maybe in a couple years..? Haha.. 

Chicken Mole Enchiladas -- As I remember it although I thought this one had a tad bit more spiciness to it? After a bite of the molcajetes, I thought that it was not spicy anymore...lol. Two chicken enchiladas with a generous about of mole sauce served with rice and beans(beans were in a crunchy tortilla cup). 

Molcajetes -- Ooh spicy!! My husband ate most of this. I don't remember much since I was focused on enjoying mole. Grilled nopal, onions, peppers, salsa, avocado. Spicy, spicy. 

Free chips and salsa. 

Yes, it is a bit expensive but if I were to make that mole sauce, I would be spending much more.

Can I just buy bottles of mole sauce from them and put it on everything? Please, pretty please?? Getting hungry just imagining it..."

While the crowd was more blue-haired than hip, the interior look of Fork is more updated and artsy. And the food..... from the butternut squash soup to the smoked pumpkin tortolini to the lightly fried halibut and chips, great care went into the preparation and presentation of each item we sampled. Even the kale salad, which might have been expected to be boring, was brought to life with creme fraiche and sourdough chips. Dessert? Think spicy fig ice cream with Madagascar chocolate cake, which tasted even better than it sounds. A nice wine list rounds out one of the best bruch experiences i've had in a long time."

She continues listening to the other customer's conversation and slowly rings me up then after the transaction is complete leaves my purchase on her side of the counter as she walks away. I had to reach across the counter to grab my purchase. The customer behind me was also not acknowledged and left standing there as the female clerk seemed to wander off.

I like to wander, see what's new and buy myself something pretty. And by 'pretty' I mean 'delicious.' I'm a bit embarrassed to note that I don't know the local ice cream shops in Brentwood. If I did, I would frequent them. But fate landed me in Brentwood's Hill Center complex* and the soft neon called out to me, demanding that I partake of the deliciousness.

By this stage in the game, you already know what to expect when it comes to Jeni's, so I won't belabor that point. It's fairly remarkable that the chain has taken so well to Middle Tennessee. Again, I'm a bit conflicted because there are local ice cream shops that deserve our love, admiration and dollars but dangit if Jeni's doesn't have a reliably wonderful product. It's hard to deny.

This Jeni's has the added benefit of being new. So you can anticipate all the things you have come to expect from Jeni's (quality product, nice workers, clean environment, not cheap prices) in a brand-spanking-new facility with good summer hours (closing at 11). So, stop in for decadent & original (but not off-the-wall) flavors, good-sized scoops, generous sundaes, fresh toppings, and all the samples you can fit in your ever-expanding belly.**

The reason I'll always have a fond memory of  Haverford's Wendy's is when I was going to Methacton High back in the 70s, this one was the only one in the area.  I kid you not.  They weren't everywhere then like they are now--and it was by accident I discovered the one on Lancaster Avenue because I didn't know it was there.  Their catch phrase was Hot-N-Juicy and that's exactly what the burgers were.  I couldn't wait till I got out of school Friday, hop on my bike, and ride the 17 miles from my house to this Wendy's in Haverford.

They say some things never change.  While about every six weeks I'll patronize my local Wendy's, I make it a point once a year to go back to Haverford.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the staff isn't exactly congenial sometimes, but hey, that's to be expected at a fast-food establishment.  I'm not a spring chicken anymore so I have to watch how much beef I eat, so I have the Spicy Chicken combo.  Not a bad alternative.  In the spring when they have their fish sandwiches, theirs are better than McDonald's or Burger King's, in my mind.  Sometimes I'll swap my fries for chili because that's good stuff too."

The biggest difference from the hand tossed to the ""deep dish"" was the crust was super thick all the way to the center.  The amount of toppings was about the same.

This location has a GREAT cosmetics/beauty section, headed up by Toni.  I'm not sure how long she has been there, but I've been seeing her around for a few months now and she's nothing short of spectacular!  She has such a passion for makeup and skin care.  Take the time to talk to her and you'll see.  She is so great with the customers and really knows her stuff.  I believe she has experience in makeup artistry and has worked for Estee Lauder in the past, as I remember from our conversations.  There is a difference between someone who is great with customers who is trying to make a sale (as you'd get in department stores - DUH - they work off commission, as I did more than 20 years ago when I worked for Chanel) and someone who genuinely just enjoys working with people, working in a field they have passion for.  Toni just informed me that NYX cosmetics is finally coming to Walgreen's and they are setting up a HUGE display for it and I cannot wait!

The three of us decided to just get half a dozen of the hot and fresh donuts to share. Our friend has had the other speciality donuts before but highly recommended the hot and fresh ones as all donuts are better fresh out of the fryer.

The cashier was super friendly and chatted with our friend that lived there. When she learned that my fiance and I were getting married, she comped us the iced coffee we were getting. Super friendly and generous. The donuts took a little bit to get out, but they were made to order. When we got the box, it smelled amazing and was very warm. We walked back to our friend's place before digging in.

These donuts were everything. Warm, fresh, soft, and perfect. The strawberry lavendar was my favorite. You could clearly taste the two distinct flavors, and they melded perfectly together. The cinnamon sugar one was fantastic as well. I could eat half a dozen myself.

Our Wawa is not only relatively clean, but also safe. This is due to the police station located, literally, directly next door. I don't see how this location is not doing good business, there usually so many people in there.

I have had some ornery cashiers, but for the most part the workers there are pretty nice. I have even witnessed some disturbingly bubbly employees at this Wawa, highly unusual. 

They make good sandwiches and now they carry everyone's favorite sugar fix- Vitaminwater."

They have there awesome ordering system to tell you what steps are being taken, and when it says that your carhop is on the way' - they aren't. They take out multiple orders at a time, which I feel like slows them down. 

I ordered a BLT, no tomato & with cheese & they forgot the cheese. So I rang back in and the attendant was not very friendly and was speeding through the order. I again waited and it told me my car hop was on the way, and she was in fact on the way to another car. 

I will be passing this sonic, as I've tried to give it a few chances and it's the same slow service, bad customer service and wrong orders every time.

The rolls have a good texture to them, not too tough but not mushy either.  I had the Club Sub and the bacon was done just right too.

Fried pickles: these were EXTREMELY salty! We we not able to enjoy them as much as the blossom for an appetizer.   

Full rack of ribs: I'm not a bbq or rib fan at all but the person that had these loved them! And that's a that matters! My nephew enjoyed them too 

Roadkill: I don't understand the concept of this steak. Personally to me it just looks and taste like a hamburger patty that is overloaded with onions, mushrooms, and cheese.

Bone in ribeye: this is absolutely my favorite steak here. I've never had problems with its flavor it's always been super good! 

What I've had before here...

Salmon: it was just ok! I love salmon but not the one here. 

Beef tips: this was my very first entree I ordered from Texas Roadhouse. I've order this entree multiple times and never disappoint me but a couple months back I found cardboard in my dish. Told my waitress and they took it off the bill. Haven't ordered it ever since.

I went inside and we went over my car info and then I waited about 15 minutes until my car was ready. They were very informative letting me know that 3 tires had great tread and one was getting low and that was also the one that had a dang nail in it! (I swear, this has happened 3 times since moving to Nashville last year!) They repaired the tired free of charge (um, I know another place I went to earlier in the summer who charged me nearly $40 for a patch-up!) and made sure all of the other tires were good and replaced a sensor that was rusty in the low tire, too.

The mussels came and they were really, really good. Great presentation, flavor and size for the money. EXCEPT....only half had opened.  

Our waitress, who was wonderful, noticed and insisted on sending the manager, despite our protests. I'd had plenty to eat, and did not want to make a scene. When the manager (I believe her name was Nikki) arrived, she immediately approached with a defensive attitude, starting with ""what seems to be the problem?""...I reiterated that we had not asked for her, but went on to explain that half of the mussels served had not opened. She smiled and stated that she understood, they are ""hard to open"".  My husband immediately pointed out that you should not open mussels that have been steamed and don't open on their own, and her response was that Red Lobster's are pasteurized so it's ""fine"".  

Neither one of us could hide our surprise to this response....she thanked us for coming in and left.  

End of story. 

I was and still remain stunned. 

When we go to Red Lobster, we don't expect high end fresh flown-in seafood. We don't. Our expectations are for really decent food, a nice quiet meal in the bar and consistent service.

They do have a nice parking lot with some free parking so that is nice. The interior was clean and well put together but nothing special.  This Dunkin Donuts could be situated anywhere-- next to a mall, outside a walmart, around the corner store, next to the CVS  and it would make no difference. In other words, nothing really made it stand out. 

I will say the selection of donuts when I go is usually pretty sparse.  Maybe I typically go when they are about to restock but I always notice there is certainly not much to choose from. On one occasion, I ordered a Boston Cream- ""We don't have them anymore."" So then I order a regular cream filled donut, ""We are out of them."" Finally, in exasperation I ordered a Raspberry Jelly Donut- still nothing.  They did give me my coffee for free though for the inconvenience of not having my first 3 donut choices. I will say though while nice from a customer service perspective, the lack of selection tends to be the rule rather than the exception. 

Overall, I will continue to come here because it is close and convenient for me but I wish they would start ordering enough donuts that there is actually a good selection available."

However, PF Chang's is a super-secret pleasure of mine.  I know it's a chain.  I know it's not necessarily good for me.  But I cannot resist sometimes.

On my recent trip to Indy, I realized I was in chain restaurant hell.  I decided I would rather eat my snacks in my hotel room than dine at the Old Spagetti Factory.  But what is it I spy?  Is that a PF Chang's?  Sure enough it was.  And after day one of video critiquing and a failed attempt to locate an allegedly great greek restaurant (we refused to cross the highway afoot in that endeavor), our hunger led us to  PFC.  Awwww shucks.

So in we went.  I love their beer selection, especially the fact that they serve Kirin Light.  You see, I believe it was on one of our first non-dates at a BYOB sushi spot that my PIC and I drank Kirin Light together.  Meeeeeeeemmmmmories.  In any event, it made me happy.  So did the almost-too-salty (but I do love salt) hot and sour soup.  One order of the salt and pepper calamari between us and we were just perfectly happy.

Service was friendly and prompt.  In my world of anti-chain ire, this place will always have a teensy spot.  Indy's version did it proud."

First Watch has a totally enormous (almost overwhelmingly so) menu, but I can appreciate the fact that they serve breakfast all day and have some good healthy options. I went with the avocado toast + the green tonic juice as I was feeling under the weather (plus about a million cups of their unlimited coffee). Both were great!

She is by far the most professional employee that I have encountered at European Wax Centers. Certainly, management material! 

My rating for 4-stars comes from the female manager who was on duty that day. I have an issue about the way the waxers are 'rushed' to get to each client. Managers communicate with waxers through beepers. India's manager beeped her at least 5 times during my session. For personal areas of people's bodies that the waxers have to attend to, ample time should be given, so that they are not rushed.

While standing in line, in walks 6 people carrying 3 pizzas from a business across the street.  They were young, loud, disruptive and took nearly 25% of the available seating in the restaurant; and they weren't even eating Taco Bell food.  

I informed the cashier, but he took one look at them and was immeditaly intimidated.  I really didn't care too much as I was getting my food to go.  However, if I had been dining in, and there was no available seating, then I would have definitely pushed the issue with the manager; and then with the ""trespassers"" if push came to shove.  Sorry for the rant, but I'm in a foul mood today.

Anyway, a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell.  The menus are all the same.  It's all about location, location, location.  And this one works fine for me."

The food was hot and delicious. I got the feta and spinach stuffed bread, the chicken with bacon and tomato, and the lava cake. All were outstanding!

I agree with some other reviewers about the decor not being as fancy or modern as other Starbucks, but I don't really care about the decorations as much as the customer service.  We ALL know that Starbucks isn't cheap, but when you have great service it feels worth it. 

Consequently - I've had HORRIBLE service at the one across the street in La Cumbre Plaza....literally the barista called out ""Venti iced coffee sweetened for Mary"" and I stood up and apologetically gestured ""Oh, I said nosweetener actually"" and she glared at me while dumping out my iced coffee (continuously glaring at me) and then refilled it and pushed it towards me.  Her coworker was standing next to her and I smiled at her and said ""Wow, what great customer service, huh?"" She just smiled and looked away.  I mean, if you hate your job it definitely shows through to your customers.

I've never had a bad experience here at this Starbucks, but I avoid the other like the plague.  I come for the coffee but I come back for the excellent service.

Delivery window was 830 to 1230.
When they hadn't delivered by 1230 called and waited another half hour for them to tell me they got a late start and they'd be here 230.
Called at 230. waiting literally a half hour. 
Hung up and called the store.
They stated the delivery was canceled (unauthorized by me)
Asked to speak to the manager. 
They stated the manager would call back in 35 minutes.  
Same clerk called back said time.  Stated that one piece will be delivered by 7pm. But the other is in back order.  
THE PIECE TO BE DELIVERED WASN'T EVEN ON OUR ORDER.

The restaurant is supposed to be open to 10pm on weeknights, at 8:45 on a Wednesday it was locked up tight and being mopped. Fine - I'll use the drive through. One person ahead of me put their order in and pulled up. I ordered a 10 piece meal for the family - all white meat. Pull up.

Ok - THIRTY minutes later I was at the window and my order had none (zero, zillch) pieces of white meat. I'm not sure if they were cooking stuff to order but I paid for the white meat and Asked the girl for it. She handed me the bucket back and before I could look inside locked the window and walked away.

4 pieces of white meat apparently translate to a ten piece bucket. She knew what she did and went hiding. Screw this place. You win honey, but I hope they shut your store down tomorrow."

Sweet Potato Fries disappointment:
I had my heart set on their sweet potato fries but when they came out they were cold and hard as if they had been out for hours. Our server apologized and had the kitchen drop another batch. Staff brought them out steaming hot but unfortunately they did not taste the same as before and my husband agreed. We then asked for the regular fries instead and they were ok. 
The Big Tavern:
Unfortunately the same thing not as good as our previous Red Robin experiences at this and other locations. The meat left a greasy after taste and wasn't very good. Good thing my husband and I split it otherwise we would have had to complain to management. 

Such a great additition to this area but needs consistency if they want to keep loyal patrons."

The people at the window couldn't understand english much as well i think and i had to repeat a few times to get my drink right. 
KFC as an organization has really gone downhill .I went to another outlet a few years ago and the chicken pieces were very small and bland.
I'm an old timer and when i first used to  buy kfc, maybe 40 yrs ago, when you bought a 4 piece meal you always got big pieces of chicken,fries,a buttered roll,gravy and a salad.

I wasn't in a position at that moment to take it back to the restaurant, so my $6 sandwich went right in the trash.

The next day I tried to use the change I had gotten from Wendy's to pay for my coffee at DD and was given my $10 back because it was counterfeit.  Great!  So instead of throwing $6 away, it was now $16.  I should have skipped the entire ordeal and just thrown a $20 bill into a dumpster."

There is one employee there who never seems to be in a happy mood, very seldom has a smile, has a poor attitude and very rarely thanks me for my purchases.  

Several times she has 1:  told me to give her all my coupons and ECBs at once.  I like to use the coupons and then see how many ECBs I can use.  2:  Has told me after we have done the coupons and ECBs, and there is still an amount due that she cannot take any more ECBs because it causes the register to recalculate.  The part that is true is that CVS has a very odd register system in that it does recalculate after total is pressed and if you try to give more ECBs but it is never a problem in any other store.

Corporate now offers an app for individuals to place their order online ahead of time. I have not used this app yet, so I cannot comment. 

The only other item I would like to point out are the fries. Consistency with seasoning is not a strong point here. Look, I am well aware we all like our seasoning differently.

Cheddars lack of staff at this location on what was evidently a busy evening means that this is a poorly managed location. I would advise caution to anyone planning to eat here - if it took five minutes for a hostess to contact us, how often do you think wait staff refill drinks or check on your order?

Regardless, this has soured me about Cheddars, which is unfortunate due to the fact that they are a chain and I travel a fair amount.

This particular evening I had the chicken chimichangas with everything. Lightly fried white or wheat tortilla, cheese, choice of filling, topped with sour cream and fresh jalapeno. Came with a side of tortilla chips. It went over my expectations.

I also loved their hot sauce bar. Lots of sauces to choose from mild to crazy HOT. 
Only complaint, wish the chips came with salss or pico. Pointless to have chips without the dip.

Overall, great flavor. The prices are great too."

We Hang up and immediately call back because we paid 17$ for some damn nachos. They finally answer and act like we can't talk to the manager but we insist to be put on hold. The manager is slurring her words and stuttering like she's on drugs. Says she can remake it if we drive up there... so we paid 17$ (including delivery) for nachos that we just have to drive up there for them to remake. I drove my friend up there and when she goes inside they keep repeating MY name (the name on the order) in a rude and disrespectful way multiple times like my friend is asking so much to have some nachos remade without meat. NACHOS ARE CHEESE SOUR CREAM TOMATOS AND CHIPS!!!! They yet again messed it up and put meat on it. Is it really that hard? Maybe they should stop hiring crack heads In the kitchen. Corporate will be called in the morning because this was completely unacceptable behavior for a paying and POLITE customer."

What they meant to say was ""huge"" fake Italian dishes. Don't get me wrong -- the breadsticks and entrees are passable, but they are also quite processed.

An analogy I like to use when it comes to OG is

Italian : Olive Garden :: Mexican : Don Pablo's

Guess who creamed the verbal section of the SAT's ;)

But I digress. Not a fan of solely pasta dishes, we opted for the chicken alfredo and the shrimp caprese. Disappointingly enough, both dishes came out with a few measly pieces of meat and a hunk of pasta... completely smothered in runny sauces. While both sauces were described differently on the menu, they both tasted the same to me.

Servers were attentive, despite handling large groups -- large, obnoxious groups, I should add -- while we were there. The arrangement of the tables were a bit odd as we were sandwiched between tables with a party of 6 or more.

So there you have it: my OG dining experience. An experience I'm sure you'll have at least once in your lifetime as well."

They are my favorite, and just the overwhelming scent of them even before you open the restaurant doors makes almost everything else on the menu a complete blur for me.  This is the easiest review in the world for me to write because the excellence of the charbroiled oysters gives Dragos  a 5 star without hesitation.   (I don't think I've ever taken a picture of my oysters because I never hesitate long enough to do so, lol). 

My other noteworthy menu selections are: 
the corn and shrimp bisque which I often get a cup of as an accompaniment to my oysters. 
the shrimp and eggplant stack which I'll occasionally get and split with someone so that I have room to enjoy my oysters and the additional half of the entree....there's so much, you could still take some home after splitting
And If you save room for dessert, the ice cream sundae and brownie a la mode are both enormous and delicious choices.  Get multiple spoons, trust me, you'll have plenty to share!

This location does need to hire more people. They need a person who handles customers ordering inside and one designated 1-2 people handling just drive thru.

They were out of a ton of stuff because no one has yet to go through the boxes and open them to restock items. 

I like this Starbucks but they really need to hire additional staff especially because they have a drive thru.

I had also brought my measurements (following the guide that Home Depot offers online).  After going through the various counter-tops with Frank's guidance, I decided on granite.  The order and payment process was simple and easy.

A week later, a gentleman came to my home from (Colonial Marble and Granite) to make the template for my counter-tops.  This process took about 20 minutes and my appointment for installation was for the following week.

Colonial Marble and Granite asked me to come to their factory to check out my granite piece and it was gorgeous.  (This was 3 days before installation).

Home Depot then contacted me because my measurements were just a few dollars off from the professional from Colonial Marble and Granite measurements.  I went back to Home Depot to pay the difference and was all set.

Our old counter-tops were easy to remove (Colonial Marble and Granite will remove them but for $11.00 a square foot.)

The installers arrived and did a fabulous job.  My kitchen counter-top and island look beautiful.

I thought this might be a bad night until i started looking at the reviews on Yelp and they did the same thing to someone at 4:30 that decided to take the time to write something.
THEY HAVE A BIG problem at this location! FIRE THE MANAGER, TRAIN GM AND FRANCHISEE AND CLEAN HOUSE."

 I haven't had any problems yet. But maybe is bc all of my orders are through mobile. So is pretty much walk in and walk out within minutes.

My sweet little son orders the scary face pancakes..
And i order something generic and hard to mess up.
Our food comes out and gets to the table.

Our professional sandwich maker Jermy was very polite, professional and greeted us as we entered the building but I do not think having a half dozen of his friends there while he was working was such a great idea as it seemed to be very distracting for him. Almost every sandwich making item needed to be refilled by him as we were going through our orders.

One great thing about this location is the serving sizes are a little bigger than other locations we have been to. Example: Pastrami is normally presorted in to individual serving sizes at other locations but that is not the case here which results in larger servings of meat."

Don't let the name express fool you, the food is fast and prepared beforehand (about 8 hours ago), but uses fresh and qaulity ingredients . The food is kept stewing under heat lamps, which really brings out an old, left out, kinda taste to the food, because who wants fresh flavors? (no one). The food is nothing short of culinary genius and really reflects the authentic cooking and flavors of China. My favorite dish: The Orange Chicken. A delectable, supremely prepared dish that harkens to true Hunanese cooking. Each bite of sweet, gloopy, fried, chickenless, melancholy captivates my taste buds in beautiful symphony. Their Chow Mein, is also nothing short of spectacular. These oily, burnt noodles, really capture what true chinese cooking is all about. So I definitely give my recommendation for anyone to come here. It's a great thing that Panda Express is a chain, because you have access to delicousness literally anywhere.

Due to food allergies, I have to special order everything, and that seemed like a bother to them. I had to ask for basic things like napkins, straws, a fork, and ketchup. The manager on duty acted like her cell phone was the only thing around her instead of coaching her employees to be more attentive. Now, the food itself was hot and accurate, but we all know that if you just take an extra second and go the extra step. I mean, seriously, you are not doing us a service by being there to feed us cause we really could cook at home. If the owner had seen that, he would have split a hair.

I've been to my fair share and beyond of CFA locations and have seen the craziness that events like Spirit Nights can bring but this one took the cake and then some.  The drive thru line wrapped around the store and every parking space was gone.

Now of course I was going to turn around back onto Cross Keys Road and head elsewhere but I noticed something.  Considering how off the wall things were, the drive thru line was actually moving, very slowly I might add but indeed it was moving.

The secret was having two people standing outside with laminated menu cards and iPad type devices taking orders along with any CC payments and another person standing outside by the pick up window sort of expediting the orders to make sure that everyone was getting everything they needed.

This system worked perfectly to keep things moving along and at the very least our order was 100% accurate, tasted as usual CFA perfect and the overall wait time wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, screw the CEO's asinine political views because this chain knows customer service and they know how to pump out excellent fast food (oxymoronic I know) at a reasonable price.

Most of my party didn't arrive until closer to 9am and by the time we were done the place was packed and lots of people were waiting to get seated.  As I was saying... busy place.  

Our table had ordered a variety of things but by some coincidence all the men ordered the same dish with their eggs done differently (country fried steak and eggs).  That's because well... that dish is so good.  The gravy I found to be OK but not as peppery as I'd like and thankfully they didn't pour on too much as I forgot to ask for it on the side.  I usually do that because too much gravy makes the meat lose it's ""crunch"".  

My wife had wanted some mugs because she collects them from restaurants all over and we were able to purchase a couple, one old style and one new.

Because our party was large we had multiple coffee thermoses at our table with more than sufficient milk and real cream, not that non-dairy creamer oil based whatever...

I explained that my child was choking and we are paying customers (with other paid beverages) and we just needed some water. I again was told I would have to pay. My 4 year old refused to drink the soda that his older siblings had.

I was then given a credit card refund for the discontinued item.    I was told it would take 5-10 business days to process.   6 weeks later I'm still waiting for it to appear on my card.

I called to check on whether they stocked a medication that my grandchild needed. First, I was on hold waiting for the pharmacy to answer for over 5 minutes (8:30pm- not usually a high traffic time) before the pharmacy ever picked up. Once they answered, they refused to tell me whether or not they stocked the drug because ""that is their policy.""  When the tech transferred me to the Pharmacist, he told me that they do not give out information because ""they have been robbed."" He was very curt. This was very very frustrating, as every other pharmacy I called was very nice about it and was willing to check or offer to order. Walgreens across the street went so far as to call another store and located it for me. DO NOT GO TO CVS AT DAN JONES RD AND ROCKVILLE!!!!!  Go to Walgreens across the street or the CVS on 267 at 100N (they are pretty awesome too).

The toast. This place is all about the toast. I found it hard to resist the BHappy peanut butter toast, which was a thick patty of bread lathered with the most scrumptious of just enough chunky PBs. It was almost like a thick crunchy oatmeal. The bread is made from organic flour, and the BHappy brand is something I will be trying to track down on the Interwebz.

I also ordered The California Dreamer (Avocado, White Cheddar, Sour Cream and Fresh Jalapeños), which was exactly what this California girl was hoping for. Not only did it look fresh, it tasted fresh to the max, as well. Bonus: they use fresh free-range eggs from Indiana farms, so I could dream of CA but feel good about supporting local farms. The omelette came with choice of toast (opted for the cinnamon) and a cup of fruit. The cup of fruit wasn't your run of the mill melon, it was a hearty mix of the good stuff with a sprinkling of the push aside stuff (but even the push aside stuff you ended up devouring because it looked so fresh). And the cinnamon toast...well, another masterpiece from Patachou. I started to get creative and scrape some the cinnamon concoction on to my knife and spread it on the PB toast. Heaven!"

Just over a month ago we ordered a pizza and after having to call back several times over the next 90 minutes wondering what was taking so long, e're told t's on the way and then finally that the pizza had been thrown away. 

They wouldn't give us a refund and said we could get a free pizza that night or get one later. By this point the pizza was over two hours late. So, we opted for a later date. What they did not tell us is that the free pizza was only valid for 30 days. Either they left that detail out on purpose, or whoever we spoke to forgot. Just called back tonight and they essentially said there's nothing they can do. Definitely the worst service I've ever had."

I must say, Domino's have come a long way. The hand tossed crust was crispy and flavorful.  The toppings were plentiful and the overall quality of both pizzas was surprising.  The customer service was good and I'll definitely be back next month for another one.

5 year old:  ""I like to play at McDonalds, have fun at McDonalds...I like to go down the slide, I'm not afraid of the slide.  I always have fun at McDonalds - and I always love you guys.""

My other 5 year old:  ""I like eating chicken nuggets, fries, and tea.  That's it - three.""

9 year old:  ""I don't know, I really don't play that often - I really like the food I guess.""

Now my turn - I like how the drive thru is so fast.  In the morning, I order a sausage mcmuffin no egg, and while I'm paying, the employee at the next window already has it in a bag with her hand out the window waiting for me.  The sausage mcmuffin and hash browns are awesome.

Not a big fan of their bugers (actually they are kind of scary).  But the chicken nuggets and sauces are great, and the sweet tea is great, and the prices are perfect.

I wish they would regulate the temperature in the play area a little better - sometimes too hot, sometimes freezing.

Overall, 4 stars for what it is.  Check them out if you haven't already - especially if you have kids."

It had two broken legs and we didn't want to move it but had to so another woman had a roll of paper towels and we had the cardboard bottom that our dog food came in you I padded around the kitten and slid it onto the cardboard but I didn't even get to the truck and it died.

Regarding the food, it's decent. Lots of choice and they will make your order however you like it.

Side note, their paying station where you can pay/play games for a dollar (?) are often broken, out of paper to print your receipt or just off. It's a shame because it's an ingenious system but it's not being maintained properly.

It's in a small strip of stores, so the layout is a little weird. The ordering area is only maybe two to three car lengths before the pick-up/pay window, so you don't have to loop around a typical square standalone store.

The folks working have generally been nice, and my order is often ready to go by the time I reach the window, which means they must be moving at lightning speed. I've yet to experience any errors, but my order is also fairly simple -- medium coffee, extra cream and sugar (which I need to stop ordering because it's bad for your teeth and everything else, but ugh too good).

But sometimes I'm a Homer at heart!). but with rice, pinto beans chicken, and everything else that I chose to add on it was worth that inevitable run to the bathroom that I'm probably going to make later. And I liked that they hooked up soda refills and had plenty of Tabasco and hot sauce for each table.

Big mistake. Huge. 

Time and time again they fill the entire cup with big chunks of ice and then put in the coffee. The result is a cup of coffee that I finish before the ice even melts. My grande was probably a quarter cup of actual coffee. Last time I asked them not to do this and they did it anyway. This time I totally forgot to mention it, but I feel as if it's common sense.

This new Starbucks at the corner of Olive and N. Woodsmill is not only conveniently located, but it's FAST! (Zippidy Doo-Dah!)

The number 1 thing I look for when there's a drive-thru is SPEED. How quickly can you place your order and have it made/ready for you at the next window? Most Starbucks take around 5 minutes, with the longest I've ever waited taking 17 minutes. YES. 17 Minutes in a DRIVE-THRU. :|   We received our drinks immediately after we paid. Super fast, and super friendly!

The Starbucks at this location does have a walk-up window as well and a small dining area outside, but does not allow for customers to come in. For people like me who are often on the go, this is perfect!

My favorite drinks: Chai Tea Latte & Vanilla Bean Frappuccinos!"

The chicken sandwich was exceptionally tasty. The chicken breast was so moist and tender and had a delicious crunchy coating. The bun was also fresh and was slathered in mayo and a few  pickle slices. The fries had a nice flavor too. Drinks were self serve at the drinking fountain. There was even a sweet tea station.

Wingstop is my go to when I'm craving wings to eat during the game. I prefer the traditional wings with bone over boneless because the chicken is always juicier when the bone is involved. When it comes to flavors, I typically go with Original Hot, Garlic Parmesan, and Lemon Pepper. In addition to their phenomenal wings, they also have really good french fries that are perfectly seasoned. I am a huge ranch fan so I love to dip my fries and wings in their ranch. In my opinion, Wingstop has some of the best ranch you can get at a chain. If you're craving wings then you have got to check out Wingstop.

As far as chains go, their service is decent, but nothing special. Most of the time when I order my wings in advance they're ready when I arrive, but there have been times when they have been super behind. All in all, they get the job done."

For brunch, it was hard to decide what to get because everything sounded and looked so delicious. I ended up getting the Smoked Lox Benedict, which consisted of toasted rye bread, topped with cream cheese and smoked lox, topped with two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, red onions, and crispy capers, and served with potatoes sauteed with rosemary (instead of peppers due to pepper allergy).

The hot food bar is delicious as well. I came here for lunch and got shepherd's pie, veggies, and Mac & cheese for about $10. There is also a fresh 'Thai Salad' bar and pizza bar. There is a window where you can order complete meals such as burgers, brisket sandwiches, salmon, chicken dishes, and much more.

Since I'm not a frequent diner I notice the menu options are always different. Same food...just presented in different value deals. 

The food is just basic diner food. I like it better than Denny's or IHOP. It's small, but you can see how everything is being cooked and the service seems to be consistent across all waffle houses in every state I've tried one in.

It is a bit on the small side, though it is two floors because of the space given in the mall. But, you can find anything you need quickly and easily. There is just less stock.

Regardless I watched as someone sitting in a mobile order pick up spot was handed their shamrock shake after being told they didn't have any.  I asked the associate if it had literally just broken before I asked for one since the other customer was being handed one right then and she looked surprised and gave some roundabout excuse.

   I understand that some things are harder to make or a pain for the workers but it is an offering and advertised everywhere.  If you were actually out I would understand but blatantly lying and then doubling down is rude, unprofessional, and horrible customer service.

If you're here looking for a review on the rest of my order... the food was mediocre at best as most McDonald's are - thrown together and sitting under a heat lamp slowly becoming the cardboard from whence it was created.  I do frequent McDonald's on rare occasions but being lied to (to my face) is new."

Both times service was on the slower-then-typical side in my opinion. The first time there was employees being trained, which was explained when I ordered, so I knew to expect a longer-then-normal wait.

The second, most recent time, there were more employees working but service was still so slow from beginning to end. 

To top it all off, right after I got my drink another customer came back with her iced tea because there was some sort of small, flying bug in it. Gross. I won't bother with this location again, there is a stand alone Starbucks directly across the street (with a drive thru even!!)"

The food here has never made me ill. So I guess I should be thankful for that after the whole poisoning snafu. 

Also they always place your food container in a brown paper bag. They don't even ask you if you are taking it 'to go' or eating at the food court. It's a huge waste of paper. I have to stop them before they place it in the bag.

Another annoyance at all Chipotle's in general is that they really slather on the sour cream and cheese. No human needs to ingest that much dairy to protein ratio. I tell them to go light and they usually listen.

My car was acting up the other day, so I had my wife take it in to have it looked at.  Come to find out that it's my master cylinder (brakes) that needs to be replaced.  My wife gets the quote- $400!  After conferring with some co-workers, this price seems kinda high.  I call to get the break down, and they tell me the part is going to be $160.  Funny, they sell the part for $70.  When I asked about the disparity, the guy told me ""we have to order it from another place, because we don't have any in stock.""  Wasn't too friendly about saying so either.  It's these kind of people that make my wife uncomfortable about coming into an auto place.

We ended up finding the part at Auto Zone, so we brought it in and had them do the work.  I asked them to put the old core back in the box, so we could get a core refund.  Yeah, they definitely forgot to do that.  Thankfully they didn't lose it, or they would've seen a large Asian man flying across the counter.

If my car had been in better shape, I would've taken it some where after the initial diagnosis/rude customer service.  I needs to find me a local mom and pops joint.  I doubt I will come back here if my car needs work.

She is easy to talk to and seems more like a friend than a service worker which is awesome when lying half naked on a table. Sadly, im only in the area every 4 to 6 weeks, so by then i feel hairy...she had no problem with slightly longer hair. Both times I checked in quickly and early and was taken back right away.

Unlike the location a mile north on 86th street, this place is fairly quiet ad subdued. There's no drive through, so if you want to get something, you've got to park and walk in and get it yourself. I'm okay with this... it means it much quieter than the others. The staff sets my mobile order on the counter so I can walk in, say hello, grab my order and be on my way before the my headlights have a chance to shut themselves off. They've learned that I don't like my pastry warmed up, which isn't an option to request on the app, but they know when y order comes through how I like it, and they have it ready.

I had the ""small"" cheeseburger and Cajun fries. I wasn't disappointed, but it was way too much for lunch -- I could barely stay awake for the rest of the afternoon with all that food in my belly! 

One of the best things about Five Guys is all the topping choices -- your typical veggies, plus relish, A1 Steak Sauce, BBQ sauce, jalapenos, sauteed onions and sauteed mushrooms. I opted for the sauteed onions & 'shrooms, which were great. The burgers are deliciously greasy, with just the right amount of gooey cheese and a buttered, grilled bun. Altogether, I was pretty happy with the burger. I probably won't order the Cajun fries again, as the seasoning was just a tad too spicy for me. Another great bonus about the place is that there are peanuts for you to eat while you're waiting on your food. Five Guys also serves grilled cheese and hot dogs. 

Five Guys is a good place if you're in the mood for a good, greasy burger. Just be prepared -- there's not a single healthy option on the menu!"

I'm embarrassed to say after living here for over three years now I finally made it in for Sunday brunch. Third time definitely is the charm because that is the number of times we showed up reservation-less but hoping for the best. Our wait this time was only 30 minutes so compared to the previous visits with almost 1 1/2 - 2 hour expected wait times we jumped on this opportunity. 

The hostess is amazing and our server was even better. We were seated outside and they had a fan blowing directly toward our tables so that made me very happy. As far as drinks, we did the popular Bloody Mary bar. They strayed from the usual Bloody Mary pickled garnishes and it was nice. My chosen entree was the banana foster's French toast. It was good but I couldn't even eat most of it because our creamy Grits appetizer plus two bloody Mary's had me full. Don't worry I enjoyed them later in the day and they were still really good. 

The moral of the story is the food is good and everybody already knows it. Use open table to reserve your spot ahead of time. If you feel like hanging around awhile though you can always just show up and add your name to the wait list."

Jenny should be happy she is employed in this thriving economy instead of making uneducated comments to her fellow co workers.

Second the menu is eclectic with burgers, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, tacos, churros, and more. Third they're open 24 hours offering the whole menu all day. Finally you can order at a kiosk. The kiosk has a great user interface and it's nice when the people in front of you are *slow*.

I've had the bacon ultimate cheeseburger. It's good enough to have again, but not amazing. The french fries - regular or curly - are fine. 

They have two for 99c tacos. I'm guessing these taste best at 2am. The taco sauce is thick like a (slightly) spicy ketchup. Not for me.

The winner is bacon cheese fries. These are so good. These are so ooie gooie that you'll eat them with a fork. Try these with sour cream or ranch dressing for a real treat.

Another winner is the 5 for a $1 mini cookies with that fresh from the oven taste."

Just on principle alone, I will have to tell you that I was quite dissatisfied with my Cajun Fish Sandwich. I wrote a Yelp review about the merits of the restaurant I've been to and even gave it 5 stars for the excellent chicken sandwiches there, but I will have to say that your fish sandwich is probably the worst fish sandwich I've ever eaten. Sadly, a McDonald's fish sandwich tastes better than this! My fish filet was smelly and mealy and didn't taste appetizing at all.

You can't complain about the coffee - since they stand by the Starbucks promise of remaking your beverage if it's not up to standard. The food is standard: your danishes, bars, and prepackaged salads/sandwiches (which are a lifesaver, but not without a price: I cringe each time I recall the time I stumbled desperately into this Starbucks looking for something to eat after a 7 hour study session and wound up spending ten dollars on a tea and a cheese sandwich. True story). 

Study-wise? Well, you can't go wrong - and here's why:

- It's in the library. If you can't get your stuff done at Starbucks, please, move to one of the numerous other rooms/floors in the library. 

- That said, if you want to snag a seat in the Starbucks seating area - you better get there when it opens (don't know the hours? Just click the site link and it'll take you to the calendar of hours for the month) or during an off-peak hour (typically after lunch, when people tend to take most their classes). Sunday is always an option - it is a tomb in there on Sundays.

- I recommend this spot if you're doing some reading for a lit class. Starbucks is a social spot, and the air is always abuzz with conversation. I found it is far easier to ignore it when you're reading a book or a short story for class. It is not so easy when you're doing math, or reading an article for a political science class.

- Wifi is free, but only for USF students/faculty/staff."

During the past few months they have not called back as they said they would.  Most recently they advised they couldn't fix it and would send a new nightstand.  On the day it was supposed to be delivered they called and said it was damaged and they couldn't ship it.  Since then I have been promised a call back and still have not received one.

I ended up ordering one of their new dishes though, an All American Bacon Scramble. It was OK. The cheese they used seemed a bit sweet for me, so.. I didn't eat it all. The hash browns were ok, and the pancakes, I upgraded to chocolate chip ones were a lovely treat.. I could only eat about half though. 

The husband opted for a spicy omelette that had everything but the kitchen sink in it and came with a hot pepper on the side. He devoured it as if he hadn't eaten in a week. He got himself a triple stack of blueberry pancakes.. he said it was YUMMY!

This place suffers from the 1-review yelper. People in the suburbs who only review things when they are bad, it's unfortunate. 

I came here a few times over the years, truth be told because the last KFC by me (in the gallery mall) shut down years ago. I have come here when we were expecting blizzards the next day, I have come hear close to closing, and I have come here during lunch. My experiences were as follows:

It has always been clean. Sometimes the service is slow for fast food, but it's not slow in the usual sense of the word. If you come 1 hour until closing they are going to run out of certain pieces of chicken. They have always gotten my order right. The chicken is always fresh and hot.

I was able to eat Chinese food & be full for only 540 calories! I ordered a plate with Fire Cracker Shrimp (110 calories), Broccoli Beef (150 calories), Mixed Vegetables (90 calories), and a side of Crab Rangoon (190 calories for 3 pieces). I really like that they offer low calorie dishes. They have a lot of ""Wok Smart"" items that are 300 calories or less. The food was ok... it's fast food so we can't have high expectations. The firecracker shrimp was good, the beef broccoli could use a little more salt & the veggies could use a little more salt. It's  actually good that they don't use a lot of salt.  Having less salt is better than being too salty, right?  I don't eat at Chinese restaurants as often as I would like to because I'm trying to lose weight. It's hard being a foodie without getting fat. The struggle is real. I would def come here more often now that I know I can have my Chinese food fix & still eat healthy.

Expensive? Yes, definitely on the higher end of the genre. This place makes Olive Garden look like an Italian McDonald's.

I also decided to try the tots since I hadn't seen them on the menu at other locations. Considering how long the line took to move, I was surprised at how quickly my food was prepared. I took my first bite of burger and it tasted nothing like what I'm used to from Smashburger! It had a terrible flavor and I ended up stopping after half.

While our super-friendly server (whose name I forget) took our orders, I noticed she was wearing a button that read something like: ""WE CARD BECAUSE WE CARE"".

I asked her where I could get one and she said she'd look into it. During the meal, she stopped by to give me my very own button, for free! That's special treatment, and it earned her a nice tip.

It was my first time trying hush puppies and they weren't bad but I didn't love them either. My friend tried them and said usually they're supposed to be more savory, and the hush puppies here were sweeter than she was expecting. My po-boy wasn't bad but again I wasn't in love with it either. And as for the bread pudding, it was good but it came out room temperature. I really wish it had been hotter temperature-wise, as I know the bread pudding would have been delicious if that was the case.

So while we wait we start to play with our place settings (there's games on them for kids) and try to entertain ourselves.  Not much out the window except DD next door and broad st traffic itself.

Pizza comes out and it looks good...It's in the pan we remember...but crust is not super golden...it just barely got there.  Still crispy but the taste isn't the same.  3 of use shared the large pizza and as the slices were disappearing, the bigger the view of the pool of oil in the pan..our pizza was swimming in oil...so we left full but man...i could feel my heart clog.  so glad we checked that off the list.  back to pizza hut hiatus."

Two things I'd suggest.. avoid the onion rings.. (they are better a Burger King or Carl's Jr) and CHECK your drive thru order before you leave, because after all, them burger jockies inside are people too and stuff happens!

In the mood for rice?  Try the terriyaki bowl!  Breakfast? You can't go wrong with the Breakfast Jack.  The sirloin burger is the bomb and if ar in a highly carnivorous state.. The ULTIMATE DOULBLE CHEESEBURGER.. with no wussy lettuce and tomato to take up space.

I went in and ordered it to go instead of doing the drive thru. It was spotless throughout, including the bathroom. It looks like it had recently been remodeled. The cashier here was really friendly and made it a good experience. The burrito bowl was decent for what it is. Not as good as Chipotle by any means, but since it has the quick convenience factor, that's a plus

Instead of actually helping by getting up, she kept at whatever she was working on.

I order the Asiago Ranch Chicken sandwiches and hand the kid at the register the coupon. He can't figure out why it won't take the coupon. Finally someone tells him that it's not for the ""premium"" sandwiches. OK, fine I'm on my 30 minute lunch so I just order one grilled and one fried both with extra mayo to go.

Something tells me to check the bag before I leave. I open the grilled sandwich and it has no mayo but it's totally douched with some strange looking sauce. I go back to the register and tell him this has no mayo and some sauce I didn't order. He looks at me like I'm a space alien and says ""the grilled don't come with mayo they come with honey mustard"" Don't you think that a better time to tell me that would have been when I ORDERED EXTRA MAYO?? 

The old dude behind him starts remaking the sandwich so I stand there and watch. He notices that I'm watching and finally throws the wrong sandwich away. I knew he was going to just give me a new bun but he saw me watching. And guess what he doesn't put on the sandwich? You got it, NO MAYO. I told junior at the register that he didn't put ANY mayo on the sandwich. Back to old dude who says ""OH JESUS CHRIST"" like I'm the problem.

Another point deducted because of portion size. I asked for double meat, and she only gave me 50% of normal, and when I pointed this out, she said no that's double. I eat at Subway all the time and it was NOT double. I suspect it was because it was the last slice  in the container and she was too lazy to go open a new one.

Third star deducted because the register card reader didn't work at all and I had to try my card a bunch of times. I don't carry cash so if the card didn't work, what was I supposed to do? It was stressful, and I don't like stress when I'm hungry for a sandwich."

A possible save would be to order the vegetables steamed instead of smothered in tasteless sauce, but I don't know.

Anyway, Chase Elliot won the Nascar race on Sunday. I got an email saying they had a promotion stating that since Chase won the race, that if I buy 10 wings that I will get 10 free boneless wings for free. This is because Hooters is a sponsor for the number 9 Hooters Chase Elliot race car  in the Nascar series race. It just so happens to be a Chevrolet. It's Chevrolet's first race to win a race in the Nascar race in several months.

Menu items ordered:  10 Texas Smoked BBq wings and 10 boneless medium sauce wings. Anyway, all the wings tasted pretty good but the 10 Texas Smoked BBq wings were a little dry.

When I tried to claim insurance they told me they couldn't honor the claim because they couldn't inspect the boxes, and even if they did, it probably wouldn't be honored anyway because I packed the boxes myself and they have many rules about all objects being at least 2 inches from the side of the box etc.

So, I park, I go inside, I explain the situation to the ""manager"" with the blonde, pink and electric blue hair. She has the crew make the Whopper while the rest of my food gets cold. I point out to her that it's the third time in a row this BK location has messed up an order by me and responds with something about how it's her first day back after being out for awhile. This BK is close and I like the menu. Each time my order gets screwed up I vow not to come back, but then after a couple months I give it another chance. Hopefully a couple months from now something will finally get fixed."

The sandwich artist was distant and unsupportive, but she works for Subway in a Walmart, so that's understandable. My sandwich was devastatingly underwhelming, and fragrantly fetid, despite using fresh ingredients and excellent preparation.

I know it's not your fault, franchisee. The corporate decisions are enforced and the profit margin is generous.

But the new Corned Beef Rueben tastes like feet.

I followed all the recommendations: eye bread, toasted, sauerkraut and thousand island with no additions. And I know that rye bread can smell a little boggy, sauerkraut a pungent tang, corned beef can be salty af and thousand island can be very, very sweet. But those flavors are supposed to blend into an ensemble cast of savory-sweet-crisp-pungent goodness that pubs have relied on for generations. They are Not supposed to sulk in peaty wheat bread, moist lunch meat and albino pickled lettuce, pouting about not being in a real restaurant.  None of these ""ingredients"" stood up to being called ""food"". And I was HUNGRY, so I gave it my best attitude. It's a damndable tragedy."

I had attempted to try the other shop too through Yelp, but Yelp put me in this one only .  This location seems to have offered one more free scoop for me but it was also probably a more fitting venue for me to try based on my own mannerisms and past reviews.

I went in the other day for a top off and the guy was again pretty nonpersonable and in a matter of fact way told me, after the fact, that if i had needed any fluids I would be charged because I didn't pay for the upgraded oil change......2 days later, I checked my fluids, just for the heck of it, and found that I had no wiper fluid and was a quart low on transmission oil.....so my assumption is that when I went in for the top off, no one really checked anything......with so many other places to get your oil changed and given these guys don't seem to want my business, I will go to another place/competitor......."

The restaurant itself is located a little off the beaten path with a small parking lot. Luckily we were able to find parking on a side street, which was just a short walk away.

The place was packed, and I mean so much so that there was almost no room to stand. It is good that the staff does seem to have a system in place for seating patrons and they seem to turn over tables quickly. The food itself is very good. I had the mole enchiladas with a side of chips and guacamole. The mole sauce was rich and flavorful and the chicken in the enchiladas was seasoned excellently. The guac was also very fresh as were the chips and salsa. The salsa bar actually has a multitude of choices from mild to hot which is nice.

The only reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel because of the small dining area, and the enormous crowds, they should switch from order at the counter and get your own drinks to table side service. It is just too chaotic and hectic as it is and it is a struggle to even get yourself to the soda/water fountain or salsa bar when it is a packed time of day.

Despite the crowds, this is a 5 star establishment based on food alone and is worth coming back to."

The management is non-existent.  I blame them for the horrible employees because they most likely do the hiring.

Inside, I have no idea what was in there, but it didn't resemble anything like beef or cheese that I'm used to getting with this order.  I chucked it in the bin, rather than ruin my golf game early the next morning.

I have had numerous problems with this location, from erroneous orders to ""we don't have no beef or chicken or beans"".

I've had the managers and the regional managers call me at home and beg me to give it another chance, but it all comes back to the fact that the ""help"" there is simply incompetent or past caring.

A last observation...they act like their hot sauce is a precious commodity there.  When I order 2 or 3 items I need at least 5 hot-sauce packets per item.  They act like they can only give 2 or 3 per item.  I usually end up having to pull around and go inside and ""help myself"" to the sauce in the bins...assuming they aren't empty.

Like the Burger King that closed up at Park and Broadway because the ""help"" sucked, this Taco Bell needs to be leveled to take the temptation to try it again away.  No matter what they do, day or night, early or late...it's gonna suck!"

Baaaad vibes. One thing I'm learning quickly as new Nashvillian is that service most everywhere except for BBQ joints and bars is lukewarm at best. Food service employees county-wide carry a general disposition like you're interrupting their busy daily-grind of doing jack shit. On balance, a 'how's your day going?' is met with a kind of silence ranging from indifferent to hostile. If that's the standard, then this Q'doba would be a training ground for the terminally unambitious.

Ok the food: I'm really struggling to understand the idea here: Unless your order a pre-made menu item, you will be confronted with 35+ different unlabeled containers and zero effort on any employees part to help you figure out how to build your burrito. All I wanted was a little beans, cheese, carne and guac. Simple right? 

I pointed to a container with what looked like refried beans in it, only it had that firm crust-like skin on top, the result of sitting unstirred in the open air for hours.

'Are those beans?'

'No...'

.......

No answer. 

Screw it. I'll just figure it out. She then literally put a teaspoon's worth of guacamole on the burrito. I'm not greedy but what kind of heartless savage does that? That's grounds for a Western stand-off in San Diego. When I politely asked for a little more, she huffed and then put a tortilla in the warmer for a whole 10 seconds resulting in a burrito chewier than Gramma Bea's 89-year-old elbow skin. The other ingredients? About as zesty as wet cardboard. (always wanted to use that word 'zesty'!) The manager seemed cool but this place has no love folks. 

No. Love."

The ribs on the other hand were very good.  Pull off the bone smoked, with tender meat and nice rub and bark.  Each table had 6 bottle rockets with various sauces to be squirted on to moisten and flavor the chew.

Products: Prescription and OTC drugs, associated medical treatments and devices, beauty products, and snacks, all of average quality. There are some decent specials and sales on occasion. 3 stars

Service: This is a mixed bag. Sometimes, there are good employees working the counter. Other times, it is horrible. It's a complete dice roll as to what you'll get. The employees are more reactive than proactive, and this leads to long, slow lines at the register. Most are quite friendly, but I get the impression they aren't trained well. 2 stars

Facilities: The business occupies the river side of one of the corners of Napoleon and South Claiborne. It is a stand-alone brick-and-mortar common with this chain. Outside, the private parking lot is kept neat, but inside is commonly a mess, with stock out-of-place or just not stocked and on the floor. I attribute such to the probable poor training noted above. Bums frequent the outside in rather large droves regularly. I also suspect this is due to lack of vigilance by the employees. Overall, an unwelcoming atmosphere. 1 star

I am not one to get fussy about young people being young but this was inexcusable and if I was the manager on duty I would not have allowed him to be on the floor. 

It ended up being a tasty as heck bowl and even though I don't discriminate against rice, that new cauli rice is totally yummmmmm! 

I recommend mobile ordering from this location. 

Also is it just me or do Chipotle employees all suddenly hate their jobs? Because this is my 4th Chipotle experience since 2019 with miserable customer service and I could have sworn they used to be the friendliest people ever."

We ordered calamari, ahi tuna, mushroom ravioli, and a filet bacon cheeseburger. I'm still amazed that each of those items could be only $6, especially for the quality they were offering. We also topped off the meal with a dessert, the creme brulee, that was heavenly!

The environment and ambiance of the restaurant didn't hurt either. It was very sheek. I also tend to judge restaurants by their restrooms, and Fleming's met the criteria. ;)

To top off the entire experience, the service was impeccable. The staff makes every customer feel like a million bucks and they treat you as such.

Our salesperson was very informative throughout the purchasing process and even sent us a thank-you note a few days later. She said that they're supposed to tell us 3-4 weeks for delivery (because the furniture is built after you order it) but that it could be sooner. Our furniture was then delivered 8 days later.

It is true, however, that all sales are final (I'm guessing this is because they build the furniture specially for you after you order it). This is why you should measure your space at home and be totally sure about the furniture you're buying before going through with it. I asked about this before making the purchase, and she said that we cannot return it if we change our minds.

Product: Typical pseudo-Mexican fare for this fast food chain. It's definitely a guilt pleasure on occasion, and the food is consistent, if a bit low quality. But, hey, what do you expect? It's an American fast food chain. (3 stars)

Service: For a long while, the service here was horrid--food came out cold and took forever, service was slow, and the people working there were generally rude. Not in the past couple of years, though---I don't know if they changed franchiseship, if corporate received enough complaints to warrant coming in to change the culture, or if the management and employee turnover finally lead to a favorable outcome, but they've definitely stepped up their game at this location. I'd say service was previously earning a 1-star rating. Now, though, they've made a move for the better. The service is now speedy and friendly, all with getting the order correct. (4 stars)

Facilities: There's really nothing special here. It is a typical stand-alone building with drive through, private lot parking right off DeGaulle, and seating inside. The place is usually clean inside and out. (3 stars)

Overall: In the past, I'd say avoid this location at all costs, but service is so improved from what I've seen that I can safely suggest this place for your cheap taco or burrito cravings once again. (3 stars)"

The sad part is she is clearly new and young, if you care about your business you probably wouldn't leave one person at any time especially during lunch hour.  She is expected to take an order, make the order, ring up the order, answer the phone, check for pickup orders, re-stock veg and deli meats, and clean the tables all alone.  Lets talk about safety as well, alone in the store doesn't real bode well for potential nefarious activities.  I would easily be a $30/week customer but now because of time constraints I just head to the big grocer across the parking lot.

I'll try again in 3 months.  **Hopefully ownership hires more people or staffs more than 1 during lunch hour"""

Cracker Barrel I've missed you from my childhood days when my Mom and Dad drove to every vacation destination we went to. They would stop here many times and my brothers and sisters always loved coming here because we could play checkers, or color, or rock in the rocking chairs! And then we came here again, when my ex-husband and I took our kids while they were growing up! You haven't changed much! That same country porch with the rocking chairs & the kitchy gifts to browse through are all still there, as well as the same home-cooked meals, for good prices, and true down home goodness.

I arrived at about 6:30pm and placed my order, then browsed while it was prepared. I waited about 10 minutes, while chatting with several of the ladies up front. Talk about southern hospitality! These girls nailed friendliness!

I had the sugar cured ham (I love those breakfast-type steaks for dinner!), with steak fries, crunchy cole slaw, cornbread, a biscuit & their famous chocolate fudge Coca-Cola cake with hand made vanilla bean ice-cream. Jess had the meatloaf and I had a bite of hers and actually liked hers better than mine lol. 

Everything was just like you sat down at home and Mom served you dinner. So if you miss your Mom and for some reason cannot see her, go here and have dinner, because it's the next best thing! Honestly!"

They don't have the best of wings, your sauce choice can make or break it. Televisions everywhere... we can watch sport highlights, UFC fight, football, a hockey fight and trivia all at once. I'm a little irritated that they only play sound on the televisions when it's a major game; otherwise you're listening to the music and making up your own commentary. The staff is attentive and they bring napkins to the table without asking. Happy Hour specials from 3p-6p. They are pretty pricey when it comes to the food but I guess you pay for the atmosphere. 

They recently update the restaurant with different tables, chairs, games, more televisions, booths and even a new wait staff area. Not sure how new this is since the last time I was here 6 months ago.

I wanted to select the tires while I was there but they assured me that they would call me  soon to discuss which tires to install.

It took 2 1/2 hours just to receive the call, and when they did, they told me I had a bad tire, which was what I had told them when I dropped the car off.   It would be like going to McDonalds and ordering a big mac, then having them come out after 5 minutes and saying, ""we have Big Mac's, would you like to try one.""

Some type of communication problem seemed to exist between the crew members and I was frustrated.  I just walked back and paid for the oil change and left.  I ended up taking the car to another tire service company and got the service I expected from Firestone."

I was desperate, and by long shot decided to try arranging the transaction through the ups store that can handle the packing and shipping to me. Jerome even agreed to help me pay the seller since the amount was so low. Talk about going above and beyond for someone he hasn't even met! I thought this was a sealed deal- how easy for the seller to go drop off the item and pick up his money, no leaking his personal info anywhere. Didn't even need to provide his name, only mine, but sadly it was still too much work for the seller and it didn't work out :(

Bottom line is this place is as awesome as the reviews say, and I'd definitely reach out again if such similar transaction were to occur in the future. THANKS JEROME!!"

I drove (literally) across the street to Lowes:
- I called Home Depot to see if I could leverage the Lowes visit - two more employees said no, yet could not articulate why 24hrs of display time was worth so much
- Lowes had the same unit, but unfortunately no display model...but when I explained where I came from, and what my need was, the customer service rep said: ""My personal goal is to make you want to come back!  Please take this ticket to the cash, and come back in 40 mins - we'll have it assembled"".

I returned 35 mins later, and it was ready to go  :-)

It's really disappointing that this is the case because we love having a chick-fil-a in this area, but it just feels as though they can't get the system down.

The waygu sliders were crispy on the outside (not a good omen for a tender burger), kinda like hockey pucks. They were not a good taste, but the sauce and garnish helped -- A LOT!

The cod sliders were HUGE, incredibly hot right out of the fryer. Wonderful, beautifully fried cod. Tender, moist fish. And the lettuce, tomato, onion and sauce accoutrements added good flavor and a balance of fresh.

The bread was flaky... That I love.  Mikes seemed fresh instead of traditional store bought bread that is so condensed and feels like a brick after you eat it.  Just thought I'd respond."

They knew they were wrong from the beginning and could have just been upfront about the situation. After confronting the supervisor he apologized and refunded/comp'ed the entire order."

A no cooking day today! Chef's out.

We tried calling three different restaurants after 5 pm for dinner, and either they didn't answer or it was an hour and half wait time...

Since, we live down the street, online ordering was fast and efficient. It even gave me less than hour to pick up.

So simple, headed down there, and they had maybe ten cars waiting for the orders. Plenty of staff running to your car to get your info.

My pick up time was 6:30, and we had it in the car by 6:27!

I ordered slightly pink on the steaks, and one was more red, and the other had no pink.. so I couldn't justify 5 stars..I also requested extra salad dressing but no extra provided.

The blooming onion was good, but not as hot as I would of preferred. Still good with my homemade Red Robin sauce!

If I'm short on time, and craving steak we will be ordering again!"

This was challenging for the waiter and waitress we had and they well exceeded our expectations with smiles on their faces. I highly recommend them for large groups.

Of course the breadsticks were amazing, but I did their build your own pasta and really enjoyed the asiago garlic alfredo over linguine with chicken on top. Very tasty. In fact, I didn't see a single person disappointed in their meal and there were a LOT of us. Service was also quick, even for a table as large as ours, and the restaurant was pretty busy on a Friday night. 

All that being said, I recommend them highly."

Our server really knew his stuff and was able to talk about each of the beers in detail.  I ended up trying the India Black Ale, a special this month, and enjoyed it a lot.  It was similar to a regular IPA, but with a stout-y little twist.  

We ordered the chicken nachos and they were also better than they had been on my first visit.  The toppings were held securely in place by the cheese and sour cream, and there was more chicken. 

I shall return with cautious optimism."

My hubby and I met his family here over the summer for lunch and the service and food was sub par. I really don't like giving bad or negative ratings so I just decided to skip one all together however, this time hubby and I were coming from downtown around two and he mentioned coming here and giving them another try. I rolled my eyes but I was hungry and decided to take one for the team. We were sat right away near the bar & the bartender took our drink order and we ordered the loaded fries. Once our drinks came we ordered our lunch, we both decided on soup and salad. It was a good 10-15 minutes before our meals came out and she got my soup wrong, I honestly do not know how french onion soup sounds anything like Broccoli cheddar. So I had to wait again for the french onion soup. Please keep in mind our fries never came out, she never checked on us or asked if we needed refills. I was so annoyed because they were not busy at all I just asked for a check. 

Sadly this place has really taken a turn for the worse and you are better going somewhere they will treat you better."

Even though it's just off of I-4, it's a pain the butt to get to.  The road has a good deal of traffic and there are U-Turns involved which is never quick or fun.

The drive-thru is hellishly slow.  There are two different drive-thru lanes and the people in them have no concept of who is to go next which just leaves people cutting each other off left and right.  

The food was not hot and it was haphazardly put together.  There must have been about two - three tablespoons of ketchup on my burger.  Yuck.  No napkins in the bag.  So, messy food with no napkins.  Lovely.

Neither of the people at either of the drive-thru windows smiled or even so much as said one word.  

What I thought would be a quick 10 minute stopped turned into a more than a half hour ordeal.  Seriously...  it took more than 30 minutes just to get food from the drive-thru of a FAST FOOD joint.

Never, ever will I stop here again on the way to or from Tampa!"

It tasted good, but it looked gorgeous. It almost looked like the advertisement. I saw all these reviews about customer service. If you make the pizza well and get it to me, that's what I'm paying for. Although a tad bit late. It is gorgeous. See for yourself.

The atmosphere here is nice, clean, plenty of space between tables, and not very loud inside besides the music coming from the speakers.. 
Even though this restaurant, in my opinion, can be considered a fast food joint, it is nice to have your food made when ordered and plated very nicely, instead of taken from a heater lamp or refrigerator  and handed to you in a bag.... I had a chicken cobb salad and a cup of black bean soup, my wife had an asian bbq chicken salad, my 16 and 11 year olds had smoked ham panini, and my 3 year old had a smoke ham and cheese sandwich.... All of that for around roughly $45.. not bad at all..... Everybody enjoyed their meals and the friendly staff.. I'll have to think of going here more often when I'm out with the kids. Especially since I could have gone through any drive through, which I'm not a fan of, and would have paid about $35 to hear someone at the speaker keep asking ""is that all"" after the first item is ordered,  be given cold food which should be served hot, and an attitude from the cashier at the window while they're basically tossing a couple bags in your hand..."

When one of the waiters dos notice us he seemed almost confused that we were there. He asked us how big our party was...we were the only two standing in the lobby. So we get seated in the bar area and hopefully would have been greeted by our waitress. Not a single person approached us for about 15 minutes. During that time I made eye contact with several of the staff there and not a single one notified our waitress of our arrival. I'm not the type of person that seeks out a waiter/waitress in a restaurant because that is not my job. So I gave them a little more time to get there stuff together and we still did not get served anything not even drinks. We got up and left. I am very disappointed in the lack of professionalism with the wait staff. They have lost another customer for life. At least this particular location.

A couple of the cars thought I was holding up the line and when they left the line, they honked and yelled at me.

When I finally was able to order, the food was delicious and hit the spot! I hope in the future, if they get a large order, they asked the vehicle to move up to a parking spot so others can order and get their lunch in a more efficient way.

I know it was not essential for me to go to Lowe's today. So I ordered online with the intention of doing curbside pick up, as they had advertised. I pulled up, parked in the designated area, and called. And called. With no answer for 5 minutes, phone ringing off the hook. So I decided to go inside thinking it would take 5 minutes, they said my order was ready and it was only a small pick-up (again, non-essential, I know, I really regret going). I went to customer service and was completely blown away by the number of people in the store. IT WAS INSANE. More people than I have EVER seen in Lowe's. Then in order to be acknowledged by the people behind the counter I had to politely initiate my transaction. The worker who helped me seemed to have very minimal training as she didn't understand where the computer was telling her that my order was stored at. After 10 minutes the manager finally came over and told her my pick up was literally right behind the checkout counter. Then my entire order was not ready and it took another 20 minutes to get it together. Leaving me time to become very anxious about customers and staff VERY MUCH NOT keeping their 6 feet distance from each other and myself. 

Overall I DO NOT recommend visiting Lowe's at this time. They are not taking this pandemic seriously and I definitely learned my lesson to discontinue making non-essential trips."

Why have I not come here for such a long time I thought to myself?    Then I looked down at my receipt and realized I just paid $13.33 for a burger,  frys, and a drink.   Is that experience?  Or am I cheap?  I left very full which is a good thing because I'm out of money now.  :)"

It is on the corner of a building next to a very compact little parking lot.  It's hard to explain, but the flow of the drive through is just plain weird.  We were the only customers the day we pulled in and that seldom happens at any Dunkin.  I don't think they get nearly as much business as other locations due to their crappy location.  It's just not an easy one to pull in and out of.  That said, the workers were nice and one of the ladies gave my dog a couple of munchkins. My dog didn't want to eat them, but it was still a nice gesture."

Walking in, the place was well kept with plenty of room to dine or simply order and take away. I approached the cashier while checking out their bakery products on the back wall and immediately in front of me behind glass. I went with an Everything Bagel, Chive/ Onion Spread and a thin Brownie that winked at me as I spoke with the cashier. Finally, a light roast java to wash it all down. 

When I spread it all out on my desk, I learned that I would do the spreading. No sweat, knife included. The bagel was fresh, but the soft variety, rather than the crisp chew I prefer. Still, it was acceptable and I enjoyed it. The Brownie was likewise soft, but nicely chocolatey throughout. Half was covered with powdered sugar, giving it a sweet kick without overwhelming the basic premise of these brown squares. Finally, the Joe was hot and tasty from the light roast, which I often like more than the stronger heavier darker roasts. 

Bottom line, this was a decent late morning snack for a busy day, and I won't hesitate to visit again next time I am near The College."

They sent my annual ""Happy Birthday, Free Food For You,"" voucher last week, so Thursday morning, after a particularly sloshed birthday celebration, my brother, my sister, and I took our hungover tooshies to get some grub.

We split an order of boneless buffalo wings, then I went for the chicken fajitas, brother had the chicken penne, and sister had the A-1 Realburger. I was hesitant to taste the penne after the experience I had at Chammps, but, o.m.g. it was good. Everything else was just perfect, as always, but next time, I'm going for the chicken penne.

Side notes: 
1- I am so weak over those Realburger commercials. (They make me want to run screaming up 15th Street and demand as much beef as they can give me as fast as I can shove it into my big, fat mouth.)
2 - A tad annoying that my voucher always specifies the Aramingo location, when 15th Street is within walking distance, but, oh well. 
3-  I think the hiring manager must be a woman, cuz those men/boys in there are BEE-YOO-TEE-FUL. And our waiter was a doll. Wanted to take him home with me. So sweet."

It is comforting food that your Grandmother made and is hard to find, when eating out.  The chicken & dumplings is a favorite, as well as their famous meatloaf.  They peel, cook and mash their potatoes.  They have a wonderful thing called a hash brown casserole, loaded with cheddar cheese and onions.  

They make biscuits all day long and you can have them with a sausage gravy.  They have one of the best bacon cheeseburgers I have ever had and absolutely the best reuben sandwich.  They have a pancake or french toast breakfast that includes eggs and meat.  Oh, they do have the best bacon, I have ever had, It is thick sliced apple wood bacon. Yum..getting hungry here..anyway...

On weekends they can be packed and the food takes a bit of time, but they have a store, that people shop in or checker tables too, well you know, play checkers! .  Service is fair to wonderful, depending on who you get. Right now they are running a Southwest chicken special, that is sooo good!  Oh and they have good mac & cheese. 

Desserts are homemade, breakfast is served all day long from opening to closing.  If you have a hankering for turnip greens or pinto beans or fried okra or catfish grilled or fried, look no further!  if you like a good fish fry on Fridays they have the best battered fried Cod I have ever had!"

Domino's has been advertising their ""new"" pizza so I figured I'd check it out since I was stuck indoors from a recent snowstorm.  I ordered from Dominos.com after I found a good promo - 2 Mediums with 2 Toppings for $5.99 each.  It was easy to order and the Website even had a status bar showing where in the baking/delivery process the  pizza was.  It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive after ordering, which may be longer than normal because of the snow on the roads.

As far as the pizza, it was decent, which is an improvement.  The size of the pizza was larger than before.  We ordered the new garlic style crust, it tasted good, but my hands were covered in greasy garlic while I was eating.  Still, Domino's new pizza has notably improved."

The 3 star rating isn't a reflection of the prices though.  I bought roughly 25 bulbs, so I cannot complain too much.  

The 3 stars is more because of the fact that I never use this place.  It's hard to rate a place based only on a major light bulb purchase.  However, as easy a purchase as it should have been, I spent a long while looking at bulbs and trying to find the bulbs I needed.  I never did find the bulbs I wanted, partially because the selection was so large that I couldn't decipher the differences between them all.  I wanted a simple 75 or 100 watt equivalent ecobulb, but only found the 60 watt versions.  After ten minutes of NOT finding what I wanted, I picked up the 60 watt bulbs and headed out.

We scored big time. The energy was to say the least, electrifying while the place was sprawling with a swanky full bar as the main focal point. 

Our server and the rest of the staff truly embodied that southern hospitality which made us feel right at home. Impressively, drink and food orders were taken and served in a timely manner despite how busy they were. 

Kicked-off our palates with half a dozen of Grilled Lemon Blue Point Oysters which I expected to be similar to New Orlean's Felix's chargrilled oysters. Verdict? Let's just say getting them fresh would have been ideal. 

Pasta in brown butter topped with two beautiful sunny side up eggs, goat cheese, and pine nuts was hard to pass up on especially when mixed with bacon lardons. A really delightful dish full of comfort. I highly recommend if you have a love for noodles like me.

I thought it couldn't get any better. One bite of the Crab Cake Hash sent me to euphoria. Chunks of crab meat were uber sweet and try pairing it with their delicious hot sauce for that extra ""umph"". I should've bought a bottle of that hot thing.

and even when their air conditioning went out over one of the hottest summers, and was out for over a month, we were met with smiling faces and friendly people.  They had a person come over from Sarasota to help out and he was great and the usual lady that works there, who always tells us to ""have a blessed day"" is great!
These days it's a different story.  There is a woman that works there, that is beyond rude.  My husband ran in to get a sub a few weeks ago and she was talking on her cell phone the entire time he was placing his order and she was making his sub.  The same woman was there on my recent visit and was not behind the counter, but sitting at a table with another woman and a small child, playing around with her cell phone.  When I walked in, she got up and went behind the counter, but she was not nice and definitely not happy that there were customers coming in.
She put her phone down and grabbed gloves without washing her hands.  Normally I would have asked this person to wash their hands (and I have, at this location to another person years ago) before putting gloves on, as they have to reach into the the pack of plastic gloves to pull them out, not guaranteeing which side of the glove is up or down. I did not this time because she seemed to be really annoyed already.
Needless to say, the sub I purchased is in the garbage because I was not taking a chance of getting sick.
I will not be going back here again while that lady is working."

Let me start by saying there as over a two year period where I frequently passed Burger King and didn't glance back. 

But, something changed. 

The impossible whopper was added to the menu and I couldn't have been a happier.

At first, I wasn't sure if I should go and try the new menu item. I did and it was delicious. 

If you are skeptical, you should try the item. While it has been a while since I have had a whopper I can tell you this- the impossible whopper was so good, I had to double check it was the item I ordered. The plant based burger was tasty and with the regular fixings that the original whopper has, it was a trip down memory lane. The vegetables were crisp, the hamburger buns were perfect, and even my side of onion rings were crisp and delicious. 

So Burger King, you have made this vegetarian a very happy one."

This is probably the only fast food place I feel comfortable eating inside the establishment. The tables are always cleared and cleaned, the employees are pleasant and helpful when needed. This chick-fil-a pays close attention to details that would make a dine-in experience stand out from the rest. For example, their bathroom doors handles are situated where you can use your forearm to open it instead of the hands you just washed, they provide bleach wipes if you would like to wipe the table yourself, they deliver the food to your table and ask if you would like anything else, they have employees roaming the dining area refilling drinks etc. Love their little extra touches they provide and it does not go unnoticed! 

The food is fresh, sauces (of which you can have as many as you would like!) are good, and if you get a salad, ALWAYS get that avocado chili ranch!! Don't bother with boring soda, get their lemonade, its the best around!"

NO CELERY - that is very bad.

The atmosphere is of a large warehouse and relatively unpleasant, with cutomers and workers that just don't seem to have a lot of joy in being there.

I loved that they were generous with the pepperoni. I usually dab excess oil off, so you can tell in the pic. there's more than I like on my pizza.

Again, my compliments to the cook for making such a delicious pizza. I am thankful to my friend, Tia, for letting me know about the free medium pizza and 1 topping promo thats currently going on. Thank you, boo, & a shoutout to you!

Also, good to know there's a Pizza Hut near me. I usually go to Papa John's that's a lil closer & they normally run a 30% off promo.

I love pizza and I love the Hut!"

Car was reserved a few days in advance but had to wait 45 minutes after the scheduled pick up time for them to clean and otherwise ""prep"" the car. Not a word was said to acknowledge the wait--making it seem like this was the way they do business. My car was soaking wet for the damage inspection and all scratches were hidden.

And the gas was noted as 7/8ths of a tank on pickup. When I'm dropping my car off at another location, do I trust the new location won't charge me for returning not full. And how do I fill to JUST 7/8ths of a tank??? Really Enterprise, you should NEVER put a customer through this concern. (And I was offered no compensation for the full tank. Not a WORD. Grrrr.)

Within 24 hours, the ""engine oil service needed soon"" light came on--and remained on for the duration of my stay. (As if I'm going to drive back to the ""nearest"" Enterprise to wait even more for them to do regular maintenance--on *my* dime? No thanks.)

Summary: it wasn't a *horrible* experience but it was a poor-to-bad experience with the car rental itself with poor customer service. Overall, far below what I get from other car rental places in the STL area.

Back to my regular rental place."

The bacon is quite good...mid-thickness and perfectly cooked. The sausage links are top notch, fat and perfectly seasoned like dwarven fingers.

First Watch succeeds because they offer a full spectrum of healthy and sinful dishes. The free coffee bar for people waiting to sit is a nice touch. Parking can suck, and the wait can stretch up to 30 minutes during peak weekend breakfast times...

We perused the new slick menu layout - instead of being a fold out menu, they've now got newly photographed food offerings in a book style menu- and i chose to have the French dip, as a starter, we chose their pretzel bites. I've had them in the past and they've been delicious, today though, they were a disappointment. The cheese was clumpy and the bites themselves tasted microwaved and over salted. 

The way the food is presented is much prettier now. Gone are the plastic baskets, now food comes neatly arranged on plates, fries come served in hammered steel buckets. Everything looks slick and delicious.  They even offer 7 different sauces for your fries that are standard, and a few other sauces that are premium for an up-charge. This is something new.

What kind of a chain restaurant is this that doesn't follow it's listed hours of operation?  I probably should have mentioned that the restaurant was busy.

Went here for breakfast with my wife this morning. We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated in a booth. First thing we noticed was how clean everything was. Nearly every ihop we've gone to in the past has sticky syrup bottles on the table and old food smeared on the walls. This one is immaculate! We appreciated the aesthetic as well, y'all partitions between the booths meant privacy for us, but still low enough to enjoy the view outside.

We were greeted by our server, Heather. She was professional, kind, and checked on us often but not to the point of annoyance. I watched the plates of food coming out of the kitchen as we waited for ours to arrive and they looked incredible. Almost like how you see them pictured in the menu (which we all know just does not happen). Once we got our food, it was perfect. It was hot, tasty, and arrived in a reasonable amount of time. We had one minor flaw in our order (my wife had ordered sausage and bacon but the cook only put bacon on the plate). She actually caught the mistake before we did and brought out sausage and apologized. Seriously, no big deal out all.

The food was great and the service was even better, so we gave the server a 40% tip because the other yelp reviews on here are ridiculous. Waiting 30 min to be seated on a *gasp* Saturday morning?? Sprinkles (which are essentially tasteless) ""contaminated"" the bottom of your child's pancake?? Come the *bleep* on. These are hardworking people just doing their job the best they can.

It was a complete waste of money. The bottomless fries are a joke and not the same as they were. The first round we got had less than 10 fries. The BLTA croissant sandwich was bland and had no flavor, the sweet potato fries were extremely salty, the chicken tenders had zero flavor and had more breading than chicken. Didn't have a single food item out of the 4 of us that was good. 

The service was super terrible. Poor guy just wasn't trained properly it seems. We had to ask for things multiple times and send back one of our orders as it was incorrect. The tablet on the table was a nightmare to use to just pay the check. 

The whole experience was terrible and I urge people to stay clear."

Drive-through July 19, 2021. I ordered two double cheeseburgers -- no buns, no ketchup, extra pickles, extra onions.

What a stinkin' mess.

Both burgers had buns.

One was a single. One was a double.

The single was slathered in ketchup. NO cheese. NO pickles. SOME onions.

The double had two pieces of cheese. SOME pickles. SOME onions. NO ketchup.

Neither burger had extra pickles or extra onions.

My soup and my friends Caesar salad came out just as fast as the waters! The zucchini frittes followed the starters. My chicken Marsala was as delicious as it normally is. But be warned does hard chicken Marsala fans- this rendition is made alot different that it's traditionally prepared. It has always worked for my taste buds, I just wouldn't ever classify it as Marsala. My friend loved her eggplant parm and truffle fries!

These guys have deals on single pizzas, as well as multiple order of pizzas.  One thing that I really like about this place is that they will make sure that you are happy with your food, with very few questions asked.

Just fyi, if you are doing a carry out order, which they actually have seperate deals for carry out orders, make sure to ask if no one picked up there order.  You can actually get deals on those items as well!  It seems as though this Domino's wants to ensure it stays in business!  They don't seem to ever stop running national promotions here!"

He hands me back my card and walks away from the window muttering ""every time I try to do something, 15 more f*cking people pull up"". Nice, right?  So I figure they're really busy and try to give him the benefit of the doubt and ignore his extremely rude attitude. He hands us our tray of beverages and then our bags of food. I had to ask for the juice box that comes with the kids meal. No parting remark but I made a point to tell him thanks and have a good night. I may have had a slightly sarcastic tone but I dealt with his awful mood so he deserved it. Then I pull into a parking spot to check to see if our orders were correct.

It's definitely more calories than I need so I don't visit Red Robin terribly frequently as a result but it's a fun place to visit just the same. I wish I was better at picking out a delicious burger from the limited time offerings though as I often pick out ones that are less delicious than I expect them to be (if they're not as good as my favourite normal burger, I  feel like I've made an ordering mistake, seeing as I really like that normal burger!).

Hard as a hockey puck on the outside with one side clearly blackened.  I waited for awhile to get the server's attention regarding the burger. When I pointed how overcooked the burger was, she just shrugged and said, ""I'll let the kitchen know."" No offer to get another one made - silly me - I just assumed she was going to do it.

Another few minutes pass but I'M HUNGRY, so I ate half of the burger in front of me, but no other burger ever made its way to my table.

Anyway. 
My updated Planet Fitness - or Why I Stopped Going:
The front desk staff was always changing. Some of them seemed downright angry, and most of them, while polite, seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else but there. 
I HATED the fact the TV channels were always tuned to some stupid station. Trying to get me to stay on a cross trainer for 30 minutes while being forced to watch a Fishing Show or a Cartoon Show is sooo not going to work. 
The cardio machines face the free weights. I like to use free weights. And I'm just paranoid enough to think that everyone is watching me use the free weights, so, guess what, I'm not going to use the free weights. 
It's so damn ugly. Black. Yellow. Dark. Yuck. 
The upside: For 20 bucks a month, I could bring a guest EVERY TIME, I could TAN as often as I wanted. But I just never wanted to go. So, those wonderful things were a waste. Oh,and then when I canceled they said they never received the letter  and there was not one person I could talk to, instead I had to the front desk, who gave me a number to call, who gave me another number to call, who gave me the run around.

My original review no longer stands - this place is the biggest sh!thole on the planet and my blood pressure is through the roof. It was the worst damn experience ever!! This place has gone DOWN HILL from opening day!!!

Basically my ""speedy checkout"" was over 20 minutes, thanks to a woman who racked up over a $100.00 tab and then walked out because she couldn't pay. The guy couldn't void the transaction himself, and there was NO ONE around who could. So we moved to a different person, who decided that her top priority was to get change for her register, even though she saw us waiting forever. 

By the time her slow a$$ was ready to ring me up, the original guy had his void done and was taking someone who just walked up, instead of the person he sent away to a ""faster"" register. 

On top of it all, there was no friggin' apology from anyone. 

I was/am so enraged that I actually called the WalMart hotline to complain, which I've never done in my life. But guess what? The ""two minute"" wait time was definitely more than five, so I hung up and got pissed all over again. 

Here I am writing this review, that will clearly have no effect at all.

The check-out line moved quickly. I paid with my card and couldn't tell it was okay to leave. The guy didn't look at me or anything. I had to figure out that my payment was accepted on my own. I kind of like getting a receipt when I pay with my credit card but that doesn't seem to be the regular thing at any Wawa. Ah, well.

Glad it's an option in Center City. Always reliable and fast!"

My first one I ordered and received an email it was ready for pick up.  When I got here it was nowhere to be found and I had to wait for them to walk all over the store to find it - fast forward a year I ordered something received a confirmation it was ready and now on 3 different people looking for the order and I've been standing here for 30 minutes. I just asked again if someone was looking for it and heard them make a call saying yes the customers here waiting. Don't know when I can expect to get out of here but quickly turning a die hard Lowes fan into a Home Depot girl.   Lowes you need to figure it out before you offer this service.  As I was about to post they just sent a fourth person to look for it!!

Nothing bad to say, the location as plenty of parking, it's very clean, all the TVs are on with so many different games, and the staff is friendly.
We found a place in the bar to hang out and were assisted right away, and checked on just the right amount of times.
I had a tasty Bloody Mary! Which is my favorite drink so I always try to sample them when I can. It was a good drink, just the right amount of spice and flavor, and the salad on top had a good variety of veggies.
For some other sustenance besides vodka soaked pickles we all split some onion rings and mozzarellas sticks, fried delicious snacks."

I finally bought a filter for my tap. After all these years of heading to do weekly grocery shopping, I didn't buy a case of water. I felt so relieved. I feel free from the endless cycle of piling up bottles to take out for weekly recycling. I'm free of whatever contaminants were lingering in the water. Man, it feels good.

   ---    ---   ---

It's not usually my style to rate chain businesses, and it's really not my style to give them 5-stars. But Whole Foods has this local business aura to it that I just can't explain. 

I think I've determined that I not only drink the Whole Foods koolaid, but I lap up every ounce of it. I love everything from the hot food stations, to the chalkboard displays, to the fact that they have a freaking tap room inside of this Whole Foods. I have definitely never seen a bar inside of a grocery store until I came here.

They have ongoing classes that you can come in and take - which is equally genius for Whole Foods, as it is for the consumer themselves. Why don't all places like this do such a thing??

If I was ever running a grocery store, I would just copy everything Whole Foods does, and shamefully try to call it my own. People would walk in and be like, 

""Wow, are we at Whole Foods?""

The people are friendly, the lines move quickly, the pharmacy moves quickly. It's like they are a team and want to make your experience the best it can be.

This Walgreens is the opposite. The cashiers move slowly or are on their cell phones, the workers block the isles with their supply carts and just chat as you try to find a way around them. I've even been pawned off multiple times when I've asked where something is located, ""Go ask so-n-so at cosmetics"" SO I go there and they tell me to go ask at the front cashout...
No one seems particularly happy here and as I was parking not too long ago, I saw one of their employees go to her car, get her ashtray, and dump it in the parking lot and drive away.
That's how you can tell someone doesn't care about their workplace. If you LITERALLY treat your workplace like a dump, then you have no reason to be there unless it really is a dump.

Rather than complaining I will just rattle off the problems and let you decide... First, we waited 40 minutes for three subs and a salad. VERY SLOW. No Italian bread, no sauce for the meatballs (so I couldn't get what I wanted there), no carved chicken for the salad, and no onions. They rang everything up and we paid before we found out about the no carved chicken. Out of the three of them no one knew how to issue a refund. They had to call someone. Wound up going to another subway, even after the 40 minute wait, for the salad. Oh yea... While we were waiting for the refund one of the employees decided to make himself a sandwich out of the meatballs they put out for my sandwich (without the sauce) and grilled that baby up for a snack for later. Nice!

I have to give cudos to the gentlemen that was there on his day off trying to help the other two do their jobs. He was at least apologetic where the other two kept indicating that it wasn't their fault.

Oh yea... Almost forgot... I wound up ordering a Oven Roasted Chicken and the dude grabs it from the bin and plops in on the bread. He commences to ask about my cheese and I ask him if he was going to heat those up. He then says ""oh yea""... Glad I didn't get anything with bacon on it...

Where to start.  The restaurant inside is absolutely filthy, think public restroom at stadium.  The help constantly violate health codes by touching their face, nose, hair even handling money without gloves or washing hands!  The help are also incredibly rude and have a true I hate working here attitude!

Once you get past the deportable filth, poor hygiene, and rudeness,the  service is absolutely ridiculously slow especially because some genius made this also a Taco Bell!  Several times using the drive thru have waited and waited only to get home to find it's the wrong order or cheated or shorted on items paid for but not in the bag!

The chicken often sits for hours until it's old, dried out and disgusting.  Don't even think of asking for a new fresh batch because you will told they can't do so until they use up the old!  The same goes for the sides which can be left over from god only knows when. 

I can honestly say I have taken food home only to have myself and family feel ill afterwards. Bottom line if you want chicken sadly you're better off buying it from Giant's hot foods bar along with fresh cole slaw , it will be tastier and cheaper ?"

This rating is specifically for their new fried chicken sandwich. Eight fast food franchises continue to battle in the Chicken Sandwich War that has skyrocketed sales of chicken sandwiches since 2019. I ate all eight of them in a single day, and McDonald's and Burger King were easily the worst.

At least the employees were very welcoming and kind. The employees at Popeyes were just straight up rude. If you want mediocre food for affordable prices, McDonald's is your kind of place. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and buy a quality sandwich."

Crusin down the street, real slow, what the fellas be yellin? You know the rest. This Outback is conveniently located in MC Thick's world famous hometown. Fun fact: This used to be a Fudruckers and Lil John (me not the rapper) used to love eating here with his parents.

I found myself in Marerro a few weeks ago at lunchtime. I was waiting to pickup a car nearby and figured Outback would be a quick lunch. 

Eating lunch at Outback seemed significantly different than eating at dinner. During dinner they seem to have their stuff together and it's normally one of the best, if not the best, of the budget steak chains. During lunch service was friendly, but something was missing. Maybe they staff new servers during the day because service was kind of off.

I really wanted to get a steak but figured that would be slightly too boujie for a work lunch. Instead, I opted for a burger. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it was juicy and cooked appropriately. 

In closing, if you're in Marrero and want a decent lunch and want to avoid the other chains, Outback may fit the bill."

The seating really set a wonderful tone as the awesome corner neighborhood coffee shop, in this quiet section of Rittenhouse. But the comfy seats are truly gone, and replaced with the typical wooden chairs and tables. Granted, there is a bit more seating for this busy location now; but this quaint neighborhood spot just became a bit more sterilized. So there's that.

Now on to the great things about this location: it's still a great neighborhood coffee shop for this quiet section of Rittenhouse, with ample (now more) seating, has a great open atmosphere, it's one of the very few area locations open through 10pm, and it may well have the coolest baristas in town - they've been the nicest, down-to-earth gals around (I'm sure there's guys too, but I haven't seen any thus far).

The play area is great, the customer service is hit or miss depending on who you get, it's not really the cleanest place either, the food is usually served cold as well. Not really my favorite location to visit. 

The people who also visit here aren't really the friendliest faces that my kid looks for at McDonald's, that's not a reflection of McDonald's though. Jus stating a fact. A lot of homeless and the likes appear to hangout here so it's hard not to associate the business with the appearance of the people here."

Anyways, the service here is of the average. And the food is just as good as expected. Only complaint is that this location does not seem to offer the better price deals as other Popeyes locations in NJ. You usually end up spending at least $7-8 on a meal that has chicken, a biscuit, your choice of side, and a drink. It's not too bad. It satisfies the Popeyes cravings."

I say ""so so"" because our server was very nice, but far from attentive. There would be long periods of time before we ever saw her. It took about 15 minutes to get our salads (they're pre-made), and it took almost an hour to get our meals. When the manager asked us how our meal was, we told her that our food had taken a really long time. She just gave us a puzzled look and said she would ""talk to the cooks."" Less than acceptable response from management in my opinion... As for the food, it was very good as it usually is. I ordered the oven baked chicken with steamed broccoli ($10.99) and my wife ordered the pulled pork with mashed potatoes ($9.99). Both were very good (especially my wife's pulled pork). The kids split the chicken critter kids meal with fries ($5.99), which is big enough for both of them to split after stuffing themselves with unlimited fresh rolls with cinnamon butter and peanuts! 

We really like going here because it's affordable and the food is usually pretty good, but the service needs a serious overhaul. I would give 3.5 - 4 stars for the food, and maybe 2 stars for the service. We will come back again, but not as often as we would if the service were better."

I couldn't return immediately, so when I did get back to try again, the Rx had been called in almost five hours prior. I went to pick it up and again there was no record of it and they just shrugged and said they didn't have it. I suggested they check their voicemail and got a blank look. I pressed further and finally one woman in the back overheard me and said she'd check the voicemail. She was listening to voicemail messages for a full 15 minutes and writing them down.

The man I spoke with on the phone I have learned is the manger, Matthew. He was kind and quick to answer all of questions. He was also the one who greeted me upon entering. He matched the competitors price (which I greatly appreciated! ),and said he would have me out in no time. 

While it was as a hair longer than the 15 minutes he promised, I didn't mind. I indulged in a cup of keurig, watched some morning news, and wrote some Yelp reviews, but of course. Not a big deal. 

Matthew was professional, friendly and down to earth. He gave me his personal card and I feel very confident leaving my car with him in the future (hopefully for just routine maintenance) and will even suggest my husband do the same with his after this easy experience. 

(We have been here a few times but none as ""memorable"" and easy as this was today!)

I will not go here anymore I'd rather drive out of my way to cherry hill or Sewell. Thanks for now ruining my hometown Starbucks experience.

I pick up my furniture, get it inside, unpack two pieces, and notice that the front is broken.  I call the Ashley Furniture store right away and talk to a lady who tells me I have to drive back to South City to pickup a replacement.  What kind of joke is that?  One would assume if a customer picks up their furniture and discovers it is damaged, the store would work with the distributor to get a replacement to my house,  or at least, to the store which is 5 minutes away. I could probably teach a monkey how to work out the logistics of getting the replacement to the store."

The store just can not seem to keep the doors or check out registers working.  Just about every time I am there more than one of the self-checkout registers is down - yesterday 3 of 4 were down.  You would think that they would open an extra register or two, but no.  In fact no dedicated registers were open - the only register open was the one in the self check out area.  Needless to say there was a pretty decent line.  If this were a 1 time event I'd write it off, but it happens just about all of the time.  The store manager or head cashier could open another register if they actually cared.  Top it off with 4 additional employees standing there doing little to nothing.

I thought putting your order into a computer system with sandwiches in four different categories with no prices listed was not the most user friendly approach, a bit tedious as you switched categories and options, and a little impersonal because you can't even talk to a human being. They had 2 computers and the girl next to me was having trouble figuring out what to order and a line formed waiting for the machines because the process is kind of lengthy if it's your first time ordering. I was able to see all the veggies, seasonings, and sauces without asking any questions so that was nice. Then they told me I had to go to a register and pay, then come back to the sandwich makers when I was ready. There were kind of a long line of people buying lotto tickets, cigarettes, and paying for gas in front of me.  Then I had to wait for them to call out a long number which I thought was kind of impersonal. Why can't they ask for a name to make the process more personal like panera or Starbucks and have a register at the sub counter so I don't have to run around?  The Philly sub ended up only being $5.60 which is cheaper than subway's Philly and way better in quality and flavor so I was pleased. The whole process took about 10minutes which wasn't too bad. I'd say service is non existent because you dont even talk to anyone and the process is a little unorthodox but their subs were good so I'll be back. Thanks!"

Ordering process: disorganized and chaotic, for approximately 5 minutes the employees were counting money and completely ignoring  customers. Avoiding eye contact etc. We eventually ordered, but customer service is just not here.

Food safety: A man walked up to the counter after I ordered.  He showed staff a completely raw chicken sandwich. Staff did not even apologize, the man walked out.

Cleanliness: The vents are caked with dust and debris the floors had filth and grime especially under the drink counter. There were moldy spots on the ceiling. 

The wait: My food actually came out promptly, but we waited at least 15 minutes for my colleagues food. They lost her order finally she got her food. 

The food: My sandwich was okay, the sauce was good and the chicken was actually cooked so that's a plus. The fries taste frozen, think freezer burn after taste. 

I could have easily given them 1 Star, but the  sandwich was good for fast food. I can see why chick filet continues to dominate. My advice is to skip the sandwich it's not worth it."

Once we arrived at Enterprise, there was one Toyota Corolla that was there, and I had to wait 10-15 minutes for it to be cleaned, and then I was good to go.

The food - everything from housemade sourdough bread served with infused butters to the prosciutto wrapped shrimp to the Caesar salad to the expertly cooked filet (paired with the recommended cabernet) and perfectly prepared lobster alongside clarified butter being kept warm with a tealight was bliss.

The flourless chocolate cake with a bowl of Chantilly cream was the perfect end to this unforgettable meal.

oh, and they recently got their drive-thru intercom fixed/repaired/re-done?? and it is like 100 decibels loud.  i swear people a mile away could hear the lady telling me that they didn't brew dark roast that day.  hopefully they've fixed this.  if not, wear earplugs.  but then again, don't bother going to this one.  find another dunkin somewhere else.  better yet, (not that i'm a boston fan cuz i hate the red sox), but you're better off going to a dunkin in boston."

I had low expectations already when my boyfriend wanted to come eat here for dinner. Our server came to the table right away and took our drink orders, I went with the Sangria and my boyfriend got a soda. I figured the Sangria would probably be $6 since this is TGI Fridays after all. We skipped out on an appetizer and I got the Cajun and shrimp pasta (half size), and my boyfriend got a chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes meal. It felt like forever for our food to come out. The food runner ended up walking past our table with our meals, because she was told the wrong table number. The entrees were served on skillets. I thought my dish was tasty but there wasn't enough shrimp and it wasn't that hot when it came out. What I did like was that the pasta came in a half and full size. My boyfriend told me that he liked his meal, I tried a piece of his chicken, but did not find it that remarkable. I was shocked after getting the bill to see that a Sangria was $10 here. The sad part is my Sangria wasn't even filled all the way. I'm glad I didn't order a second one. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon."

1. It is in a great central location and easy to get to.  A little outside of downtown St. Petersburg, you can easily get to 275 or stay on 4th St. to travel to other parts of Pinellas County.

2. They have a bar with stools by a window, so there is almost always a guaranteed place to work if you are by yourself.  Each seat even has an electrical outlet.

I asked him, ""So what happened to our server."" He replies, ""She went on her break."" There's also no other servers around and only one cook. He takes over her job. He does not have the personality suited to serve; when he spoke he mumbled. He seemed to shy and incapable for the job. The waitress also ""forgot"" to tell us of the added fees for ordering bread. She made it seem like it came with the meal instead of an additional fee. The food was mediocre and the experience sucked. No tip was left.

It was more than obvious that he should not be serving and I'm not sure how he became manager with his weak personality.

I don't usually review fast food places because they don't differ that much from one location to another wherever you may be. However, this Wendy's merits a review because they have improved by leaps and bounds recently. 

About 2 months ago this location had a major renovation. The interior is much nicer, granted it is still a Wendy's, but if you'd been here before you would know what I mean. What is most impressive for me is how much better the staff have become. 

I have had a rocky relationship with this Wendy's in the past because some of the staff have been seriously lazy i.e.: not giving me a straw when I was leaving for a long distance trip (getting on I-10 with no straw), not giving napkins, giving one ketchup packet... I could go on. They also frequently messed up my order and several time gave me other people's order... meaning I had to drive back, go inside and show them the order they gave me and my receipt for a different order. That kind of thing defeats the point of 'fast food'. 

Anyway, since the renovation, it seems like the staff have improved significantly. I have not experienced a single issue, delay, lack of straw or napkins, or improper order since they reopened. This location has made some big changes and is on the right track."

The waitress proceeded to serve the 2 couples that were already there, but when it was time for our service, a black guy came out the back to take our order. Now, I didn't think anything of it until approximately 10 minutes later, 4 families, all Caucasian came in the restaurant and were served, by guess who. The Caucasian waitress. ALL 4 FAMILIES. When I went to the front to inquire about this, the manager told me that she was too busy to take our order so the black man was sent to assist........ONLY US. Yea, right.

PH wants customers to know that know that they've made improvements to their crust.  If this is an improvement, I'd hate to know what it was like in the past.  I give them credit for being fairly generous with toppings but, tastewise, it's just bland, and the crust doesn't take well to an oven reheat.

They placed a hold for a deposit on my credit card for $200 like some car rental companies do on top of what you already pay for the rental.

I've tried asking the managers multiple times to ask their customers to park elsewhere and it doesn't appear that they're doing anything. One woman told me she is, but if I have to call back every week to say that their customers are STILL parking here (which she said she doesn't think is the case, but all of our fellow neighbors say it's not their visitors), then you're not doing a very good job of communicating the message to your customers.

The Cybex cable stations and some of the machines at Planet may not be meant for the volume of use they get. I've seen leg machines with a bolt broken and it took them several days to fix. But they do fix it. And the cable stations seem to bind up, appears to have too much slack in the cable. I notified the staff. More or less the clueless kid had no idea what to do about it.

A few key points that made my decision as such: 

-cleanliness of the STORE'S FLOOR, not just the restaurant, but specifically the floor inside the restaurant

-prompt attention upon my entry, this is dreadfully important because it makes the consumer know you're ready for business and that you're aware at all times

-a well crafted sandwich. The young man, not the dad, but the young man who appeared to be the son, made the sandwich so painstakingly perfect, I had to commend him. So many times, the sandwich is soooooo sloppy and falling apart; presentation is everything

-the taste of the food was paramount. I enjoyed EVERY bit of my sandwich... I almost wanted to go back to the store and have him create another one. 

Glad Subway is getting back on the ""not everyone eats MEAT train ""; they took away my Seafood and Crab... but this isn't the review for that. I'm just glad the veggie patty is available.

A few of the strips were nearly almost the size of nuggets and not even crispy! What am I supposed to do with half soggy chicken strips?!? Now I have to put them in the oven to give them some life. The service was great as usual and the fries were fine, but I can't give more than three stars because of these chicken nuggets oops I mean chicken strips that have disappointed me today.

After ordering maybe 20-30 pizzas from this location it is the worst of the many i've been to.  They are late constantly, they screw up the pizza to the point of inedible sometimes, they forget to cut it sometimes, they have completely incorrect orders sometimes, sometimes they knock too quietly to hear it and then leave, they close earlier than they're supposed to quite often.  One time they sold me a pizza that was completely ruined and when I took it back the kid literally said to me ""how do we know that's ours?"" i had to wait for him to dig up my order while I wait around.

My point is if you can avoid this Pizza Hut do so.  If you can't avoid it make sure you check every thing you do including tasting your pizza before you leave and checking everything they deliver to you."

It tasted like they had left it out at room temperature until it started to taste bad, and then reheated it again after that, several times.  The things were thrown extremely carelessly into the bag, the wrap was at the bottom, the (boxed) burger was on it's side on top of it, and the napkin was rolled up in a cylinder on the side of this.  The ""onions on the side"" were in a box, and these were thrown in upside-down, after having forgotten them before I said something again.

Burgers were tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The fries were crispy and seasoned with the right amount of salt. The cheese we got with our cheese fries were a bit hard though maybe because it had been sitting there for a while. My 50/50 was the exact ratio of lemonade and iced tea.

First, I needed a rental years ago while in school in St. Louis when my car was in the shop.  My Insurance agent arranged the rental through Enterprise and I was pleased.  The car was clean and the price was good.

Second, Enterprise now owns National and Alamo car rentals too.  I recently rented from Alamo in Kahului, HI and had some problems.  Please see my Alamo review for Kahului, HI.  As a result, I was forced to deal with Alamo in Dallas.  They were most difficult and so I reviewed them also-please see the review.

Enterprise actually cares about customer satisfaction-a novel concept in today's high-pressure business environment.  I promptly received a message from Kyle who is in customer service in St. Louis.  He asked for an explanation, which I provided.  He relayed my information to the risk management team and we were able to resolve the problem to my satisfaction.  I had a complaint and I really had no idea if they would agree with me but the point was that the parent company took note of my complaint and at least listened.

Kyle-thanks for caring and listening.  Next time I'm in St. Louis I'd like to shake your hand and take you out for a Ted Drewes!"

I always get the same thing. Mint shake and frisco melt. I learned from the waitress that you can use multiple coupons on the same trip. Does this make me sound cheap? too bad sometimes I am. Their burgers are decent as well and there are a lot to choose from. They have there own spice shaker on the tables and you should use that to completely cover your fries! it's so good. 

Depending on the number of people working that shift...your food will either be quick and out to your table or you will be waiting for a while... play candy crush to pass the time.

Our experience was To Go, but she made sure we had a wonderful experience here while we waited. She is awesome!!!!! After a long, disappointing travel day it was just the perfect service experience.

We took our food back to the hotel and I seriously devoured it. I've never been to a chain breakfast spot that tasted so delicious. My waffle was sweet and perfectly cooked. The eggs were standard. The hashbrowns (i got with mushroom topping) were perfect. Biscuits and gravy were good. Even the wheat toast with jam was fantastic!!!!!

This was not a Saturday night, when bad service is to be expected.

It would appear that this chain does not respect senior diners; does not respect diners in general; does not employ experienced waitstaff; and probably is poorly managed at all levels.   Unlike most restaurants,  experienced waitstaff are not on duty on Sundays. 

This restaurant is a training restaurant and they should not charge full prices.

The tracker said that the pizza was being delivered but it stayed that way for almost 45 minutes. We called them and they told us they couldn't deliver to our street because it was closed off (it was Halloween weekend), but they didn't bother to call us and let us know?? What the hell was the point of asking for a phone number on your website then? And if it's not being delivered, why lie to us on the website and say that it is?

So we walked down to the Dominos to pick up our pizza, which was not very hot anymore. It was a good thing I looked at my slice before biting into it because there was this long piece of blonde hair sticking out. Neither me nor any of the friends I was with are blonde. Totally lost my appetite.

Basically, we spent over an hour in total waiting for a pizza that had hair in it. Yum."

On the other there are two things I can find here at PetSmart that I just cannot find elsewhere or not on short notice. Two items I cannot live without from this store are the giant dogs beds and a giant bottle of dog shampoo.  I swear nowhere else besides online stores sells a dog bed my Great Dane can fit on.  When I need one I can walk in here and they always have them in stock.  As for the shampoo I  know lots of places sell dog shampoo. However none sell such a big bottle at such a great price. Keep in mind I have a Great Dane and his a big ole boy. I love the oatmeal shampoo by Top Paw!! This works best for my dog and it's pretty inexpensive.  
I know they have a lots of other products for dogs, cats, and fish, but I mainly shop here for these two specific items."

3 Adults 
 
Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 4 stars 

Background - A bite to eat during a break from the setup of the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life at McQueen High School.

Atmosphere - Cookie cutter feel for another Jimmy John's.

Food
  Drink - A fountain Coke, where the machine located it felt crowded.

  Lunch - I love capicola, and if a sub shop has it I am going to get.  They have multiple subs with the ham and I picked the #9 the Italian Night Club.  Eight inches of an awesome sub packed with Italian meats; genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham.  

Service - As I said I ordered the #9 and when I started to hand out the groups sub I was left #5 and not a #9.  I brought the sub back to the register and they do make their subs freakily fast.

Future - Yes, this location or another one of the chains locations."

Was at this location this week to pick up a quick dinner. Bought the 20 piece nuggets and when it came time to choose the sauce (this is key!) I was told only 3 sauces. There are some 6 types of sauces and they limit you to just 3 sauces for a big 20 piece nugget set? I asked the gentleman taking my order if he was for real - yup. Additionally, the restaurant actually smelled bad and was not clean. The entrance was dirty and smelled foul. Regret going to this location especially since there's another McD down the road along City Ave."

They are now happy to add as many veggies as you'd like with a smile on their face! They have become our go-to local subway as they know proper protocols for food allergies! As soon as I let them know we have food allergies they happily let me know that they will be doing a glove change and focus on the food item for my child with a food allergy! They don't make me feel rushed no matter how long the line may be! They have even made it a habit to ask if there are any peanut/nut or peanut oil allergies when you purchase their cookies! I'm happy they've turned things around and we look forward to our almost weekly trip to subway where my son can eat his meal worry free! Thank you for caring about your customers! My family appreciates it more than you know!

Love the freckled lemonade. It's pricey ($3.99) but unlimited, and they bring it to you again and again. 

Our service was good, though there were a couple times when the server forgot something or was a little delayed, but always did follow through. 

I started with the appetizer where you can pick one or two things from a list and they come with dipping sauce. I got sweet potato fries and cheese sticks with marinara and ranch. It came with marinara and sweet and spicy ketchup but I did get my ranch. The fries were great, and I actually really liked the ketchup, better than the marinara. The cheese sticks were just ok for me. 

I got a side salad too, which was standard. The ranch was good! 

My husband enjoyed his burger and fries, and a beer shake. 

I felt horrible for the guy who had to clean up the booth behind us, which looked like a hurricane hit with milk and noodle everywhere from the kid who was there with his dad who couldn't control him... he actually exclaimed ""oh my God"" when he saw it :( 

We left a good tip to try to make up for that!"

If I ever feel I'm too good for IHOP, I'll know I've gotten too big for my britches in life. The food is consistent and affordable, and it's a fantastic treat weekend mornings (since the food is either super sweet, super rich, or both!). The rotating pancake special allows you to always try something new, making IHOP my favorite ""cheat"" spot when I want to indulge (birthday cake waffles? yes please. strawberry pancakes layered with cheesecake filling in between? absolutely!). It probably goes without saying that IHOP isn't great for vegan options, but is surprisingly accommodating for vegetarians. They'll let you substitute meats in the breakfast combos for extra eggs or hash browns. The service has always been fast (the servers are very used to working in a fast-paced environments). Naturally, weekend morning brunch is often packed, but the wait has never been more than 10-15 minutes. Love it!"

I tempted fate by ordering the Baconator bacon cheeseburger.  Eating this burger is like playing Russian roulette with your arteries.  There are two quarter pound patties with two slices of cheese and as you can image....lots of bacon.  There was grease dripping off the burger and the bun was a saturated.  It was tasty!
Their fries are probably best in the market only second to McDonald's.  I also like the fact that they serve fresh brewed iced tea and not that soda machine stuff.  
The employees here were very friendly. I will probably tempt fate again next time I'm in town."

It happened to embe raining and I lost my motivation for going into the Publix locates in the same parking lot as there were no close parking spots. Since WS is a chain/franchise I wasn't crazy about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised by the 'made to order' options.

3 stars because although I enjoy well seasoned food, 2 of the flavors were way too salty; Lemon Pepper and Cajun. I liked hickory BBQ the best. Also the bleu cheese was a little ""ranchy"" in flavor and the cheese chunks were very small.

I liked the fries, but they are pretty greasy. I really loved the little corn cobs and wish I got more than one order for my whole family.

I'd definitely come back to try the regular buffalo wings and other flavors when I'm in the mood for something not so healthy!"

Their parking lot by is very dim in the evening and that brings me to my point. We have gone in after 10:30 on a few occasions and it seems to be the same two folks working. There are a few others working in the back, but for the most part these folks are alone working the self check-out. For example, Friday we went and seen a movie and stopped at Wal Mart on the way home, it was approximately,10:30. There was one little old lady working the entire front of the store. Only 3 of self check-out were working and there were no lines open. Including us there were about 5 people in line and the poor woman was doing her best to help everyone and keep up. I think, in my opinion, these folks are vulnerable especially the older lady. We went this location last year at night and there was a bomb threat. This location has had more than a few shoplift and run incidents during the day, how much more vulnerable during the night. Maybe it's because this location, bring is so close to the highway or maybe it's because it's the lost Wal-Mart...... If a business that is open all night can't maintain it's quality, close it at respectful hour or pay your workers more so they will work these God forsakened hours...... That's my 2 cents worth."

My entire table of four people was astounded of just how pleasant she was. We left a note on our receipt just telling her how wonderful she was. I have never received such kind service from someone who was just so willing to do anything. She didn't use the usual ""waitress voice"" and she didn't come off rehearsed.

Understand they just opened in downtown Boise but the whole package doesn't work for me.

First, so loud you can't hear each other speak.  They are trying way too hard to create an atmosphere in my humble opinion.  Noise kills any idea of having a business type lunch there.

Second, food is beyond bad.  Ordered the crispy chicken wrap with a Caesar side salad.  Cold flour tortilla with cold crispy chicken and a chemical type taste to the whole thing.  Maybe it was the cleaning solvents from their new kitchen????  Dressing on the Caesar salad was worse than the worst off the shelf dressing in a supermarket.

Man. This place is the WORST. 

50% of the time the person on the speaker actually yells at you, or audibly rolls their eyes, or says ""No"" to requests. The nice ones ALWAYS explain they are understaffed and over worked. 

If you arrive within 1 hour of closing, they are inevitably out of things they simply stopped cooking already. And, in case the name doesn't give it away, the thing they're least likely to have in stock is CHICKEN.

We once went and ordered an advertised meal for 8, that included two kinds of chicken, two sides and cookies. Every five minutes, the poor window waitress came to explain which new aspect of our order they didn't have, get a replacement order, then come back to tell us they were, sadly, also out of that. Literally, they were out of all original recipe, and baked chicken, all chicken strips, gravy -- which turned out fine because they were then out of mashed potatoes--green beans, corn, biscuits ... we ended up with a box of chicken wings (no breasts, no thighs, no legs), French fries and a dozen chocolate chip cookies -- because eventually they offered us cookies for every item they couldn't fulfill! And we still spent nearly $50.

Until they get their act together, I can't, in good conscience, recommend anyone try to eat there. It's ridiculous."

Everything was as we'd ordered it.  We were eventually asked about refills.  We eventually got the check.  We eventually were able to pay.  We eventually got our cards back.  And our server was very nice throughout it all.

That being said, if I'm going to spend over $20 for pizza and spend more than 2 hours in a restaurant, I'll go some place a little more upscale."

I've many times walked in to see the main guy checking temps with a thermometer. Always a 99-100 health rating on the wall. Gals there are great and may be by the book but get your order fast. The only reason for not having 5 stars is the overcharging for the Subway Melt. It's a dollar cheaper down the road and I was told the last few years it only included 2 meats when I knew it didn't.

I asked if he knew what happened to eggs when you microwave them, he just shrugged his shoulders.  No offer to re fire. My sons hammy sandwich was just sad. No offers of refills.  We had to wave the waitress down for coffee. It seems as if no one cares at all.  The cashier was rude.  When you spend over 40.00 for breakfast it should be at least hot.

But I will say the burger was... maybe just a little but ""not hot"" and the cheese was cold so the whole thing was just a little off - taste was good - not amazing or memorable, just 4 star not 5. The very inside of the cheese curds was cold. I'm not trying to be picky, but some people talked about the amazing stringy cheese curds. They were good, but just OK. The fries were good. portions were as expected for the price, which was not bad... but don't expect a dollar or value burger. I think for two peoplw we spent 17$ with no ice cream.

I agree with most of the previous posters: the food is good, the prices are fair, and for a chain restaraunt it ain't all that bad.

To me, service is a big part of the dining experience. Maybe the wait staff is overworked or maybe the management doesn't give a hoot about the service. I have no idea. I do know that the few times I have been here the place was not crowded. The servers couldn't wait to get away from the table:
""we'd also like a...wait...where did he go?!?""
*waiter ninja vanishes*

Each time I've been here I ask for extra napkins. You get one when you sit down. 1 napkin does not work for 1 big burger and finger foods. The Shroom Burger was juicy and soaked through the burger diaper. My friends seemed to have the same problem. I asked for extra napkins for the table---We recieved 1 more. This happened to each dining experience. After the burger arrived the waiter did not come back until they were ready to bring the check. Asking for a shake to go was like pulling teeth. 

So much for bottomless steak fries---I guess they disappear so they don't have to bring you more fries.


In Summary: Good food, poor service, napkin nazi's"

However, I honestly think that someone in the back doesn't know how to read (or chooses not to). 

Examples of how they've messed up my orders (each during different occasions):
- I ordered a GRILLED chicken sandwich. They gave me crispy. 
- I ordered fries with NO SALT. They give me extra salty fries
- I ordered a McGriddle, and they give me a McMuffin!! (Grrr) 
- I ordered a low-fat italian dressing for my salad. They gave me caesar dressing.

This particular UPS store is located in the big Publix shopping center along Gunn Highway (across from Sickles High School), and they have provided a business mailing address for my consulting firm for several years.

The store is open Mon - Fri from 7am - 6pm, as well as Saturdays from 10am - 2pm but they also provide their mailbox holders with a front door key so that you can access your mailbox after hours. They receive US Postal mail on a daily basis and have that sitting in your box by mid-afternoon. Since your are provided with a real mailing address instead of just a PO Box, the store will also accept packages from the various shipping companies on your behalf - and they will send an email to let you know that they have you package ready for pickup.

For small business owners they offer notary services, copying and  faxing, as well as a variety of printing, binding, packing & shipping, office supplies, and promotional products services. For the average consumer you can also use all of the services mentioned above, and many people are bringing in their Christmas gifts to be packed and shipped through UPS.

I've been a big fan of the UPS stores for many years, and appreciate having this store located in an area that I frequent on a daily basis."

The ""manager"" ran through the paperwork and told me the pads needed to be replaced (duh) and the rotors were too glazed and warped and needed to be turned, and that one of the rear caliper pistons was stuck and the whole caliper needed to be replaced.
The only reason we went in was because we happened to be in Reno and for $99.00, it would be worth having them do it.
But $775? No way!
I'm handy enough to do a full service myself, so I ordered (Advance Auto parts) a set of Wagner Platinum pads, a caliper rebuild kit and brake fluid. I got a 20% discount on the order, free shipping and a $50 gift card to use later, so all told, the parts cost $60.00.
It took just over an hour to do the full replacement of the pads, rebuild the caliper and change the fluid. 
The rotors are all fine and are at 80% of their OEM dimensions. A light cleaning with Scotchbrite pads and everything is perfect!

Even the person before me was waiting just as long as we did. And they got their sandwich at the same time as us! So that was a bit weird. I don't understand why it took sooo long to get ONE sandwich. 

Anyway, I did the ""Build Your Own"" sandwich option. I did Ciabatta bread, roasted chicken, pepper jack cheese, goat cheese, olives, lettuce, tomato and green peppers and chipotle sauce. THEY WERE OUT OF PICKLES THOUGH. It was only 11am!!! Not sure how there was a shortage of pickles so early in the day! And the store has pickles in the name so I was super disappointed about that. I love love love pickles. 

The sandwich was HUGE. So even though we paid like $14 bucks with a water , at least I feel like it was super big and filling so definitely worth the price. Delicious sandwich and the goat cheese was an excellent add.

Also had their steak bowl with rice and retried and (you can also order black beans instead if you prefer) and it was a good portion for only $8.

You have got to be kidding me. There were literally 5 target employees in the Easter section all scanning and price checking. At one point three of them gathered in a huddle to discuss something. There should be some type of management here. Please spread out your employees and ask them to practice SOCIAL DISTANCING with each other and ESPECIALLY THE CUSTOMERS! I should not have three of your employees walk within arms reach of me and within a 3 minute time period. I am very disappointed in the management of this Target store and the lack of overall education being passed down from Target Corporation as a whole.

I was in line to make my order when the employee harshly demanded that I move out of the way. I would have been fine if he had politely told me the situation, but he literally hollered at me from behind the counter and was walking around multiple times (cleaning counters? Replacing cups?) before even taking my order. Really? It was a slow evening which is why I expected it to not take too long to receive my drink. Took a total of 2 minutes being hollered at and being told to move away while being stared at, 5 minutes just to place my order and 3 minutes for my drink to be ready. 

The lag time because this employee was slow and rude was just not worth it."

two employees on two separate phone conversations at the Dickerson Pike store told me that they would waive the delivery fee on a new appliance. so i ordered the appliance online and it was delivered to the store.

""Will"" went so far as to suggest that I had instead called a different Lowes by mistake (lol, twice apparently). after I got off the phone with ""Will"" i checked my call logs and he was in fact wrong--both times I had talked to somebody in his store (ie, the Dickerson Pike store) and both people I had talked to there had--very politely i would add--OFFERED (ie, I didn't even ask) to waive the delivery fee.

The quality of the food at this location is no different relative to other stores in the chain although it may have a smaller menu. During lunch hours the long can get very long and it feels like they rush you away at the counter without much time to even put your money or credit card away. On the bright side because they are so busy the wait isn't too long after you order. Its better to get this to go and eat in your car unless you have a table already since seating can be hard to come by.

Out of all the locations I have been to, this is definitely the one I visit the most. Although not nearly as large as many of the other ones, they have all the essentials.

There is a Starbucks and a CVS on premise which will only make your life even easier. 

So back to the main reason I am writing this review - their customer service deserves five stars in itself. Not only is the staff helpful and efficient, but super friendly too! It's that kind of customer service that will keep you going back.

I am pregnant and I'm sick all day so salads from Panera are the only thing I can get down easy enough, so I have been ordering to go and taking it home for dinner. 

The first time I got a Mediterranean veggie sandwich. I specifically asked for no hummus. It's jalapeño hummus, I can't have that bc heartburn. They promised no hummus. Opened the sandwich when I got home and it had hummus. 

3 nights in a row I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. It is supposed to have Asiago bread croutons. No. They use left over bland bread for their croutons, which  didn't bother me that badly bc it's being less wasteful. The second night there was no cheese on it and a half of a little dressing cup. The salad is 10$..they give you a lot of salad, so less than half an ounce of dressing is just not okay. You pay for the dressing and the cheese. All I got was dry lettuce and the chicken. Then tonight they used FETA in the chicken Caesar salad instead of Parmesan. Who puts feta in Caesar salad?? I'm not okay with that. I had to throw it away. I couldn't eat it because the feta smelled like vomit which made me want to vomit."

It is a nicely up-scaled  fast food restaurant.  We had been waiting for months while construction slowly crept along.  At long last, we were finally in front of the massive overhead menu board.  With an intense sense of urgency, we ordered.

We both got the Culver's Deluxe burger with two patties and with everything on them.  We also ordered fries, onion rings and some chocolate shakes.  With our order number in hand, we scooped up a fist full of napkins (because bearded men are very messy eaters) and took a seat in a cozy booth.  It only took a few minutes for our food to arrive pipping hot.

The burgers actually looked like the promotional pictures on the walls!  They are very similar to the burgers at Steak and Shake by virtue of the way they are cooked..smashed.  They were quite tasty but I do prefer an un-smashed patty as far as consistency and bite goes.  They did, however, taste better than Steak and Shake's burgers.  I usually love crinkle cut fries but theirs have a coating on them that was a bit heavy.  To my great glee, the onion rings were awesome.  I will get the large size next time!

As a heads-up to anyone ordering a milkshake, mine was not a beverage!  It was a frozen dessert.  Apparently, I do not have the lung capacity necessary to drink their milkshakes through a straw.  It was very tasty to eat with the spoon provided, though.

On our next visit, we will explore the many variety of choices that they offer but we will always get some onion rings!!!!  Please stop by and give them a try."

For lunch I had to try the new chicken Siracha sandwich!  A new hot and spicy option!  The creamy aioli sauce, jack cheese and even the bun are all infused with spicy hot siracha!!!   Nice!!

Also the new power Mediterranean chicken salad had to be tried! I liked it better than the usual chicken taco salad.  It has chickpeas, white beans, quinoa, hummus, crumbled feta, vegetables with a light balsamic vinaigrette!  If you like chicken salad you've got to try this one, very tasty!

Without reservation, hands-down, no doubt about it, the WORST restaurant I have ever eaten in. I only went because my elderly former neighbor has no taste buds and wanted to go there for dinner while I was visiting from out of town.

Where do I begin? The utensils were taped inside a paper napkin (classy, eh?) and of course they were dirty. I requested clean replacements and the waitress forgot until I reminded her when the food came. The second wrapped set also contained dirty utensils, which I took to the rest room and cleaned. I'm serious.

The salad had so much vinaigrette in it that the lettuce looked like seaweed. I literally poured the dressing out on to the bread plate. None of the vegetables in this salad looked fresh in any way and could have very well been out of date. 

The complimentary bread was not bad, it was a cheesy biscuit, no doubt frozen but at least warm and flavorful. 

Anyway, my neighbor got some hideous looking catfish dish (it really looked like the bottom feeder it is) and I got coconut shrimp, which consisted of 8 medium sized dark brown shrimp (they obviously were using dirty oil that was itself burnt, on a large white platter that made the shrimp look minuscule, alongside with these tater tot things that literally bounced back when I tried to pierce them with my fork; they were raw inside and semi-frozen still. 

If all this wasn't bad enough, even the ice tea was so sour that my taste bud-less neighbor wouldn't drink it. 

I have no idea how there could be any positive reviews of this place. My meal was so bad I felt like calling the Health department to shut it down. Simply awful."

They accommodated the fact that I have three children to navigate, so I needed a large enough car to manage that. AND they got me back to my completed car upon return in a quick and efficient manner as well. The staff were ALL friendly, helpful, and sympathetic to the drivers that were inconvenienced by others who had hit them.

My group all individually ordered via the app for pickup when we left our office, and after walking there our order was ready. This was fast and easy through the app!"

Needless to say, despite my protests and reasoning with the boy, he wouldn't listen to me. So off we went on our adventure to the closest KFC location.

There were no customers in the restaurant when we pulled up and the drive-thru was clear so I thought to myself, ""ok, so this should be quick"".

Nope.

I was sorely wrong. Not only did I have to wait in a parking spot for them to bring me out my food, but I had to wait 10 mins longer than what they had told me I had to wait, which was 10 mins. 

So after 20 mins of waiting. We get our bag of food. That's way too long to be waiting for food at a fast food restaurant when it wasn't busy at all, and it wasn't during a meal rush (past 7pm).

Oh, also, they didn't take coupons that I had received in the mail for KFC from this location which is really dumb. It's not the cashier's fault because they said it wasn't in their system so there's nothing she could've done about it but seriously, that restaurant needs to get their shit together.

Expect to get diarrhea after eating the food from here.

Price: KFC prices (overpriced)

I said the pizza was made with cheese. They said they would remake it and it would be here on 45 minutes. They then called back a few minutes later to again question how the pizza had cheese on it and then eventually hung up on us. I called back and asked for a manager to talk about what happened and they appologized and again offered the replacement. I explained that at this point we didn't really trust the situation at all and just wanted a refund for the one pizza. They said they could not do a partial refund.

This is the absolute worst one I've ever had the displeasure of walking into.

Not that I care too much, I just want delicious fresh food. Don't we all?

My Girlfriend and I don't eat meat, so of course we always look forward to Chipotle's fresh grilled peppers and onions on our burrito bowls. 

When we ordered veggie bowls, the chubby girl with acne working at this location softly said, ""we don't have veggies."" We responded with, ""no problem, we'll wait for some fresh ones."" 
She then reiterated that they don't have any veggies.. I was taken back, I asked her to clarify and she responded rudely by saying they ""don't have any veggies at that location.""

Not only was I immediately infuriated because of hanger kicking it, but I was blown away by the total lack of empathy. Not once did any of the 3 teenage girls working the counter apologize, they literally didn't have the mental capacity to think outside the box, or respond like decent human beings.

It's a shame that Chipotle hires humans like this. It's a gross reflection of not only their business, but their brand. I am tempted to never support this chain again based on this sh*tty experience, but because Chipotle is literally the only fresh ""fast food"" in America, I will take my business to another location. 

Hopefully those other ""owners"" have a higher standard of service when hiring kids to run their store.

I have no problems meeting with people at the front desk per se, but it gets somewhat problematic if there are lines or if there aren't enough employees. at the counter. Thank goodness for a Gold Service line pass.

Turns out the car inventory isn't as vast as I would have liked. Like many small car rental services, cars are pre-assigned with keys with the paperwork instead of being left in the car. At least the cars are located right in the airport parking lot instead of having to shuttle it somewhere nearby. 

Since the hours at the desk are limited, there are also not a lot of employees to be onsite to help. They do have a telephone to dial at all hours, but essentially if one arrives at the airport between 1AM and 5AM, there is nothing happening. 

Lastly, when in doubt, go for the full size vehicle. They're a lot roomier than the compact kind and just a few dollars more. (#2)

Maybe it's just as well that they skipped the sign, since the sandwiches are really basic, and I can't imagine the scent of them luring anyone in the door.  I got a vegetarian sub which came on a super-soft roll (you call it soft, I call it mushy), with tomato, sprouts, cheese, mayo and ""avocado spread"" (which is really just mayo mixed with pureed avocado.  totally inferior to, say, guacamole).  The sandwich was um, salty.  And soft.  And boring.  I have no idea why anyone would eat these sandwiches over, say, a Chickie's hoagie or a Capriotti's bobbie or a Banh Mi or even a wawa shorti.

I understand this is a contractor, but the fun doesn't stop there.

With Lowe's, the staff consistently gave different numbers for prices, their computer system was continually ""down,"" the blinds specialist seemed to always be ""at lunch,"" and several other factors existed evidencing an indifference toward providing customer service. For example, I waited 30min just to be told they could not pull up my order on the computer because the system wasn't working because it was raining, and I'd have to come back later. I was told these computer problems were normal. However you want to fit it, that's really not acceptable for a business. I will say there was one individual that was competent and friendly, but she still couldn't solve the cluster of a mess this was. It took 3 weeks to simply get a price quote on the blinds we wanted.

I gave up, went to the Home Depot near Briley and Gallatin, had an appointment to measure set up the next day, and a final quote the day after for a 30% cheaper price for the same blinds.

Earlier this week,  I took the kids to Pyramid lake so they can practice driving. You can imagine 3 teenagers all practicing speed-up and stopping. We got lots of breaking practice. After a couple of hours, my Sin noticed a ""brake fluid low"" warning. We stopped the practice and I filled the brake fluid reservoir. 

4 days later, it was low again. So my wife took the truck back to them as the replaced the brakes a few months ago. The mechanic found a caliper was leaking. It was under warranty and so they said they would fix it. It took a couple hours as the mechanic had to chase down another caliper. 

Also, I seemed to have NOT put the brake fluid lid back on properly as it wasn't on when pep boys got to it. The mechanic found one lying around and put it on. We also had some brake light issues that the guys at Franktown oil change said was a wiring problem. My wife asked Pep Boys to look at it and the guy replaced a couple of bulbs. He said that was the only problem. The manager said that since it took so long, and that the caliper they installed for us was defective, he didn't charge my wife for anything.

First, the food. I ordered the single patty burger with basic stuff: pickles, lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup, and relish. I also ordered the regular size cajun fries and a regular soda. This came to nine dollars. The burger certainly tasted better than the larger chains, and seemed a bit more ""real"" than In-N-Out. The cajun fries had a kick, and the regular size were certainly more than I could eat, coming in a 16 oz. drink cup and overflowing at that. Was it worth the nine dollars? I thought the patty was a bit small for the price, and why pay for a single size serving of fries you can't eat. 

Now for the atmosphere. The place is extremely clean. The decor is kinda retro burger joint. The stacked potato bags are a nice touch. But the place is small for the size crowds they are hoping to draw. I went at lunch time. The way the place is arranged right now, the tables are crowded next to one another, with little room to move. The music level was bit high and somewhat annoying. The bathroom accomodates one person. 

I'll go back, but not often. If you want a chain burger, I think you can get a better value and a decent burger at What-A-Burger or Carl's Jr. If I'm going to spend nine or ten dollars for a burger meal, I'd rather eat at a local place that has atmosphere to match."

The service is almost always bad - forgetting a part of the order, asking if you want sauce and then not giving it to you, not mixing the syrup for the milkshakes all the way through and then only filling it up half way and filling the rest with whipped cream (really upset that time), drive through massively slow, and the wait staff is not very nice most of the time. You know that the food will be standard because it is a McDonald's, but the service should not be this bad. When they got the new machines inside where you could order yourself, I was really excited because I thought ""Great, now I don't have to talk to these people."" Then as soon as I came in the next time, it was broken. I really need to stop going here."

Me: ""What?""

Manager: ""We can put it in a smaller cup if you'd like, that way you wouldn't have space in your Grande.""

Me: ""Um, can't you just fill it with passion tea?""

Manager: ""No, we'd have to charge you. See, without the ice, it's actually using 50% more passion tea.""

Me: ""So I've been going to Starbucks in various countries and cities for at least a decade and have never been told this.""

Rather than tangent about Corporate greed, I'd just like to say that next time I want a grande passion tea lemonade without ice and a venti iced passion tea light ice, I'm ordering 1/2 a cup of lemonade, a venti hot passion tea, and a cup of ice.

This will be cheaper for me (hot tea is cheaper than iced and one venti will be more than enough for a grande and a venti cold) and save the manager the grief of having to charge me extra for a smidge more tea.

THANKS."

They do move fast as expected and promised, perhaps not as fast as some more established JJs.  But I am sure they will continue to be faster.  Will have to check out their delivery speed.

Overall good sandwiches and fast; which is why you go to a JJs."

They will lie and say they attempted to deliver, even though no slip was left and we were basically sitting next to the door at the time they claim to have tried. They ignore scheduled redeliveries. They will send you to their office to pick up your parcel, have you wait in that ridiculous line (make sure you have an hour to spare), and then tell you that your package isn't there, it's out on the truck so your carrier can pretend to try to deliver it again.

The worst is anything sent through UPS Mail Innovations or FedEx's equivalent. They will report that they attempted to deliver and the customer wasn't available; when I called to find out what was going on, the rude attendant told me they ""suspended service"" on those days. When I asked why they would lie about trying to deliver my parcel on FedEx's tracking site, I was told ""We had no other choice."" I'm sorry, WHAT? Your other choice would be to not log an attempted delivery when there wasn't one.

If you have literally any other alternative to using this post office, take it."

And tonight we learned they are gone.

If it had not been for a quality manager and two good employees at this clean and fairly new location being so nice and discussing the menu change with us, we would have simply left and gotten our dinner somewhere else.

Sure, this happens all the time at various restaurants. There are reasons for it, but it still does not change the fact that we as customers are disappointed.

Put it this way: I like Tijuana Flats. But I loved that menu item. 

The alternate items (tacos) we ordered were fine. They were prepared well, served quickly and had fresh ingredients.

Still, we did not get what we came for and are not sure when we'll be back now that we can no longer get it."

The menu consists of many traditional breakfast and lunch items with a healthier twist. I had a perfectly cooked omelette stuffed with sauteed veggies, wonderful toast from a multigrain loaf and greens with a tart vinaigrette (potatoes were also a choice.) The coffee was hot and strong, and leaving a small vacuum pot with a coffee refill is a nice touch. One slightly off note for me; there is a bowl of coffee creamers on the table, but none of them were real dairy. But my very pleasant server was happy to bring some milk from the kitchen.

This is an area rather underserved with healthy lunch options, so First Watch is a very welcome addition.

The food and service has been good every time.  The weeknight specials that end at 6 are a pretty good deal at $7.99, especially when it tastes good.  We get the Roadkill, which is chopped sirloin.   Sorry, I didn't make up the name.  It's enough for us to split if we get an extra salad, so definitely a good deal.

It's always loud. Service is always good, so I guess they are blessed with good managers.  Music is country.  Ambience is a tacky embarrasment for Texas. The waitresses dance once in a while, which entertains the little one.  

Another plus is that you can call ahead and get assigned a number so you don't have to wait too long for a table. 

I'd probably give it a higher rating, but it is a national chain, after all.   Don't want to lose my Yelp cred."

I realize that I am a much more ""mature"" client than this location typically sees, and I have had very short hair for 35 years now so there are not a lot of styling options. When I went in, I explained that I just wanted a trim and, if possible, some shaping to take out some of the ""bulk"" of my thick, wavy hair. I showed the stylist two pictures of haircuts I liked. We talked about how the stylist felt both my style and my color were aging me. I agreed and said I hoped a little shaping would help and I trusted her, because after all - hair grows back. (It was a joke!!)
I was asked if I minded if she used clippers in the back. I said no, I didn't mind because most past stylists used them on the edges in back and on my neck - I have a low hairline. Then I felt the clippers going straight up the back of head....over and over again. And I felt the scissors going across the back of my head....higher and higher. At this point I said something lame like ""that feels awfully short"" and the response was ""it'll grow back."" I was asked if I wanted the length on my bangs cut. I said no - I just wanted them textured to be wispier. She agreed... and then cut them to be about 1/2 inch long. Needless to say: I am horrified to report that I look like I was attacked by a weedwacker. Yes it will grow back eventually....but with a few tears and lots of embarrassment in the meantime."

I am a Huge Chipotle fan. As a matter of fact, Chipotle changed my view of being a vegetarian, helping me to see that you can have amazing food that is really filling and because it is so tasty you won't miss meat. Suffice to say, Chipotle has changed my life... helping a meat eat'n dude live as a vegetarian.

About THIS Chipotle:
I have eaten at Chipotle in dozens and dozens of cities. I have never been to a more disgusting Chipotle. 
So, what did I see that surprised me? Flies in the kitchen. The bottom of the cup holding the forks had some sticky mess at the bottom. Worse yet, the forks were tongs down in the goo! Tables are never whiped down. Food from previous patrons on tables and the floor. Broken bathroom faucet. Broken soap dispenser. Tell me, do you think employees are washing their hands when returning from the restroom? 

Usually Chipotle is a go to standard for good food in a clean environment. This one...not so much. Until the management changes or wakes up and does their job, I would recommend avoiding this one."

Have they reinvented the burger?  No.  Are you going to find this burger above all else?  Another no.  But are you going to get a tasty, burger, hot fries and a fresh shake? That's a 10-4.  
It is ""fast casual"" in that you order at the counter, and you get a buzzer to alert you when your food is ready.  I'm a fan.  The vibe is cool. And when I have teens and college kids visiting me, this is always an easy place to take them.  Then we can wander the shops in the area, which are very nice.

They asked if I wanted to the ""signature version"" which added bacon.  I said to just give me the regular kind.  The ""regular"" kind is the Kraft ""easy mac"" straight from the Microwave.  Of course I sent it back and asked for the rice instead.  It made me laugh, genuinely, b/c they brought out a bowl of Uncle Ben's instant microwave rice from the pouch.  

Lol, no joke.  I've been a single guy long enough to know ""easy mac"" by the name brand.  And I used to eat Uncle Ben's microwave rice pouch daily.  Now that I've got a job, I'm paying to eat like poor college kid.

Speaking as the official* Yelp Pancake Snob, I'm giving Pancake Pantry the official** Pancake Snob Seal Of Approval. I got a plate that was half wild blueberry pancakes and half Parisienne (strawberry pancakes). Both were awesome, though I think the strawberries won in the end. My lady friend had the silver dollar pancakes and some breakfast potatoes. The silver dollars were good, but I will say that the potatoes were a bit boring.

We waited about 20 minutes after getting there at about 7:45AM on a Saturday morning in the summer. Service was prompt with a bit of sass. Prices were totally reasonable, and parking was available for free immediately across the street.

It wasn't really fast service (ok it was about 3 minutes waiting for my crust) there seemed to be three people helping me or maybe sort of standing around. 

I also didn't check the ever trustworthy yelp reviews before ordering...so when I was asked if I wanted another topping after the third one was tossed on, of course my mind was like, ""how much are them extra onions and olives going to cost me girrrrl!"" Only after my pizza was in the oven that I found out I could have gone full stop and customized it with whatever I want. Thanks yelp, always saving lives in that ""let me help you bro"" - type of way. Next time.

After returning from the ladies room, that may have seen better days, I waited a little while longer for my pizza. I noticed how burnt the guy's next to mine was and said a prayer. It was definitely crisp, however I would have eaten a boot just then if it had sugar on it because me and hungry have never been friends. 

The gluten free crust was possibly too thin. The weight of the cheese was too much, and at one point I rolled the pizza up like a burrito. Perfect!

Yes!

After years and years of eating unhealthy fast food, I'd think I have a standard set of expectations. You usually get poor customer service from a kid who could care less about their job. Food usually comes out cold or wrong, over cooked, undercooked, stale, etc. That is not the case with the Taco Bell on the corner of State Road and West Chester Pike in Upper Darby. 

I have never had an experience like the one I get whenever I stop here. Even late night! The service I've gotten every time and from different people has always been the most polite, respectful and patient service. Even close to 1AM in the morning! I always feel like the person on the other side of the window appreciates their job and appreciates me as a customer. It is so different from the normal experience at other fast food restaurants. Now I am speaking from the Drive-Thru point of view. I've never been inside this restaurant, but I'd hope that the service remains the same there too.

The food has always been fresh. Nothing ever tastes old. It's always the right temperature and has just the right amount of ingredients. 

I don't give out 5 star reviews often, but when you get an all around experience like the one provided at this location, they deserve to be recognized as the best of the best when it comes to fast food and Taco Bell. 

If you're craving some Taco Bell food, commit to driving a little further and getting it from this location. 

Congrats, Taco Bell!

What is up with that Victoria Cut Filet? I would hate to see what that cow looked like and it isn't even good and never has been! 

The Bloomin Onion is yours. You invented it, you own it and no one does it better, but is it worth the visit? 

You used to serve a decent sized glass of wine at a decent price. Now you take the largest fish bowl type of wine glass and serve it with a 2 ounce cylinder of wine at its side with a racked up price. Tease."

There aren't usually any steamed vegetables in the pan when I get there, so either they're a popular side or hardly anybody orders them...so I wait a couple of minutes for freshly steamed deliciousness.  I usually get some Mandarin sauce to add a bit of flavor to them; even with the sauce, they're still so much healthier than the noodles or rice, so yay.  Everything I've had from here has been great...the string bean chicken is one of my favorites.  

Beware the soy sauce.  I'm pretty certain it has more salt than others that I've had...make sure not to overdo it or your food will taste like nothing but salt.  The hot mustard sauce is great; these used to be freely available but now the sauces are behind the counter and you've got to ask for them."

The table I was sitting at had ordered the ""table-side guacamole"". The server came out with all of the fresh ingredients and made it for you next to the table ... very fresh. It was quite delicious!

After seeing a friend order the blueberry pineapple margarita, I indulged and ordered one as well! It was very tasty without being overly sweet. 

For dinner I ordered the chipotle flat bread. 
It was huge! I only ate half. But it was quite good. I had wished the flatbread was just a little thinner and crisper.

We each asked for separate bills at our large table which I thought would be a problem. But it was not. They now have a kiosk, or a few kiosks, at each table where you can pay your bill and possibly even order your food. There is even a nutrition section where you can view the options for people with specific allergies or dietary needs.

The only bad thing about the kiosks is the advertisements... /electronic light it put on the tables is a bit distracting.

Being an old-school ""give your credit card to the server"" kind of gal, I was a bit confused on how to work the kiosk. Once I got it, it was quite easy and pain-free. It even printed out a receipt for you at the table.

It made me rethink this particular ""chain"" of restaurants. And I might go back! Especially for that margarita :-)"

They offer up free peanuts to munch on while you wait and give you an almost unlimited amount of burger toppings to choose from. The fries are fresh cut and the location of their potatoes are usually posted in the store. The patties are fresh as well and are not frozen prior to cooking.

The customer service at this location is really good. Friendly people and fast service goes a long way for a fast food joint. 

The burgers and fries tend to be on the large size and super greasy. Over all the food just seems too much and caters more to the ""give me more food instead of better food"" crowd. It's truly unnecessary to dump an extra scope of fries on the bottom of my bag. At first I though, ""wow cool, extra fries"" but then sooner realized that all that does is create a huge greasy spot on the bag eliminating my ability to put it down on anything that I care about. And besides, I can NEVER eat all the fries anyway so it just goes to waste.

If you're craving a greasy but well cooked burger with a ton of fries - Five Guys will not disappoint. If you are looking for food with a little more integrity then this isn't the place for you."

I'm all about free food. 

Part of my aversion has to do with the fact that I don't really eat a lot of seafood. Whenever I do, it must be fresh, without a hint of fishiness. Since Red Lobster is a chain restaurant, I feared that it would reek of fishy smells, and have fishy customer service to boot. 

I was dead wrong, as I found myself at a pretty solid chain restaurant devoid of the fishiness I've come to expect from places that primarily serve seafood. 

Part of that has to do with the service. Bradley was one of the best servers I have ever had anywhere, He is extremely professional, courteous, and even though my 2 visits were a month apart, he remembered my drink preferences. 

The general manager of the restaurant is very nice too, she is always willing to help out when needed, and whenever she can, makes sure to greet you when you enter and exit. 

As for the food, it is mediocre. My friend and I come here on Thursdays because of the specials, which includes the Petite Ultimate Feast, which comes with popcorn shrimp, lobster tails, and more, at the low price of $20. 

The last time we came here, I opted for the pick 4, which included a clam chowder, steak, and dessert, along with the entree. Although I wouldn't exactly say that everything tastes like it's freshly made, it was better than expected. not to mention, the fact that served within a good amount of time, cooked well, and very filling.

That said, between the great staff, the portions, and the better than expected quality of food, I think this is a solid dinner spot."

Second, it's a horrible idea to have badge pay in there! I think I've spent a little too much because I lack self control when it comes to starbucks and with a swipe of my badge it's paid for (yes, I know, its my own fault). 

I understand Starbucks isn't everyone's favorite, but I do enjoy a wonderfully made flat white. Unfortunately it's impossible to get a flat white here that tastes even half way decent. On the rare occasion that I work at the downtown Renown I always like to stop by and grab a coffee but the last 3 times I have gone in and ordered my beloved flat white it has been terrible!! Usually it's smooth and not bitter and although it has no syrup in it, it's strictly espresso and milk (I prefer the coconut milk, it gives a little different taste), it has a little hint of sweetness but it seems the espresso is always burnt when I order one here so the smoothness is taken away and it just tastes like a burnt cup of disgusting. But I do Choke it down because I need that caffiene. I have decided I will not be ordering this particular drink from them.

I went through the drive-through earlier and checked in. I got a Chalupa supreme and a double wrap crunch supreme. I drove off after spending almost $10 on two items. I took a bite of the Chalupa and it seemed extremely short on meat. So I decided to check the double crunch wrap and sure enough as you could see in the picture, there is almost no meat in it.

No I drove back to Taco Bell through the Reno air races traffic, that was bad on its own. And when I brought the food in and showed it to the lady she explained to me that there's one scoop of meat in the meal, and I showed her what was inside. Mostly sauce almost no meat. And she was very friendly and offered to remake it or to give my money back. She apologized about 34 times. Was very polite and did not have any negative attitude at all.

If this is standard fare, Taco Bell needs to consider actually putting some meat in a item that cost five dollars. For almost $10, you would expect more than just a couple of tablespoons of ground hamburger meat.

I will give them another try, as I've had good success at this place as well as I do like the flavors of their menu items."

I took the car to my mechanics and they verified all Firestone's findings. I had them fix everything and returned for round two at this Firestone with the same buyer. Although we had set up an appointment time the shop was backed up with clients and we were told it would take over two hours before they could get to us. Once the shop foreman found out that we were just there for a follow up inspection he kindly took the car in immediately and verified all the required repairs had been made within a mere ten minutes. So, that proved to me that they make honest, accurate and thorough assessments/inspections. None of those problems had been noticed by other mechanics.

Why? 
Amazing customer service. 
Fantastic prices. (this last visit I ended up with tires having 15k more tread life at $200 less than what Firestone quoted as the ""best"" they can do)
They don't over sell and will work with you to get the best tires within your budget
Sales people hold the door for you!
The sales people are honest and under promise/over deliver!

""Judgment free"" is bs. The whole deal with the ""lunk alarm"" (though it's never actually used), not slamming weights down (which sometimes might happen on accident if you try to push yourself!), etc. ruins the idea of judgment free. But overall, it is a pretty comfortable gym.

The West Chester location specifically is one of my favorites. They have the 360 room, which I have not seen at any other locations I have been to. This room is super handy -- it contains kettlebells, battle ropes, platforms, TRX, and a lot of free space for any other exercises you might want to do. It's kind of like a miscellaneous room.

The cafe is very small and so this is an in-n-out location primarily. 

I'm glad to see the baristas are all wearing masks right now and that they have strict procedures to maintain social distancing compliance. 


Also super cool to find that Starbucks has extended redemption period for birthday rewards! I got to use my birthday reward to treat my husband to a ~ridiculous~ ~indulgent~ ~dessert coffee~ (iced venti caramel macchiato) weeks after my bday. 

That's right, babe, you just got callllllled out.

The pizza was SO hot we actually had to wait to eat it. The delivery guy (not sure of his name) was a sweetheart!!! The pizza was really good!! We will probably make this our new Pizza place!!!

Mama is one happy girl!

However ....

However ... [shaking my head in a sad and dejected -- yet still attractive -- manner]

What's up with the bathroom? The toilet paper roll thingie would only give me, like, one square at a time. I practically had to bend meself in half to look under it to find the start of the roll (which I never did find) to get the thing going again. I had to make do with toilet paper crumbs.

Then the paper towel thingie was similarly hostile. What the fark, Panera? Is this some misguided, passive-aggressive attempt to go green? If so, you're just asking for a frustrated lady to bogart your napkin holders ... just sayin'.

Oh yeah. My salad was good. Rock on."

But at this location I try to avoid it as much as possible. The staff don't seem to be train in customer service and they do not clean. The Starbucks on Market Street in Center City is so much cleaner than this place.  
There was a coffee spill on the floor and it hasn't been clean. The counter was so wet that when they move the cups from the counter, water would spill over. Milk was left out so hopefully when i drink my frappe I don't have the runs from them leaving the milk out without a cap on it. Didn't seem to see a manger there and one of the worker almost fell cause the floor is slippery from the water and whatever's spill. So disgusted. Definitely will not be coming to this Starbucks."

Obviously, things are different these days. No indoor seating and your food comes in a to-go container even if you're dining in. 

I ordered the bratwurst chili cheese dog and Black Abbey pale ale. The bratwurst was really good, but I definitely wasn't a fan of building my own meal. I ended up just dipping the brat in chili and then cheese. The brat had great flavor and a nice hint of spice. The tater tots were everything! 

I love the outdoor patio here! Very spacious and lots of plant life for that nature vibe in East Nashville. There's tons string lights hanging here, so let's assume they have an awesome nighttime dining feel. 

I don't make it to East Nashville that often, but the Pharmacy is a great reason to venture out."

Does it get any better than this?? I surely don't think so! We drove on in to plentiful free parking and then walked into impeccable, friendly service that is customary with any First Watch I've visited in the past. We ordered my usual - blueberry pancake (yum! And it's as big as your face!) and avocado toast - the best to ever do it IMO. My friend had the scramble and added avocado to it, which was sautéed veggies, potatoes and the avocado set it off! The coffee was flowing and so delicious and the service was amazing. Oh! And I ordered the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cinnamon roll. Oh. My. Goodness. Starting the diet tomorrow because today was not the day for that. I love this new location!

I use to have two large fish tanks and found that petsmart prices were one of the cheapest. The decor it seemed was half price from anywhere else. They now have a new aquarium system so it looks even better. Petsmart can cater to pretty much ever animals needs. If you like to see puppies too , stop by because customers are always bringing in their pets. Ive never seen so many bulldogs in a specific area. The line ups are short and theres plenty of staff.

We have been in here when it was about 4 people eating and still the order took 30 minutes. And our order wasn't anything special. Today was probably the last straw. One hour from when we entered to when we left. Food was ok not particularly hot but not cold either. Surprising it wasn't hot since it took so long to come out.

We stopped in on the way home from Orlando and were in before it was 3pm, so we were in for happy hour pricing - half price appetizers, lower price cocktails.  We ordered the beef empanadas and the husbeast ordered their drink of the month, which we were told was one thing, but when it was delivered to the table, was a completely different drink.  We were fine with that, but would have liked to have been told 

The beef empanadas were absolutely delicious. I didn't need anything after that, I was done, I could have gone home happy right then, but I'd ordered more food, I'd gotten their fried chicken, and it was good, but those beef empanadas were so good, they over shadowed everything else.

It had been a while since I had been and this was the group pick of where to have lunch so there ya go.

They had lots of sports on TV and a little computer on the table in which you could order from. I got the triple bacon burger thinking that would be an easy lay up for any restaurant. Then I saw my food come out...
I don't know what I was imagining would find its way to my table, but what I got was like something from a drive thru. It was on the smaller side and all disheveled from itself. I know making the diner assemble their own burger is normal now, so I'll let that slide. The fry sauce I got was served in either a small shot glass or a large thimble, don't know which. Basically, it's a portion problem. Maybe I'm a fat assed American, or maybe I'm just a normal American who already worked eight hours that day? The taste is just okay. Every dish was just okay.

brunch hours.

Their food is a step up in freshness and quality of ingredients when compared to other fast-casual places of a similar nature, excepting perhaps J. Christopher's (a smaller, more local chain) and the Egg and I (another small chain). They certainly blow Waffle House out of the water. 

Of the locations I've been to, this one is okay. I get my money's worth, and the food has never been slow. The place is usually a bit understaffed, but that's the curse of the modern-day restaurant business in a segment as competitive as this one. 

In short, I'd say this location of First Watch is 'A-OK'. If you're looking for breakfast in the Brentwood area, it is a viable option, perhaps even optimal, especially if you have a party of two, thanks to the large first-come, first-serve community table near the host stand. If you're going on Sunday, all bets are off -- don't get between Southerners and their after church brunch."

We drive out of our way to get Popeyes from here. 

UPDATE: Unfortunately, given our last three trips here, we find it necessary to update the review. Each and every time we've been here of late, the staff has closed the dining room early. We're not talking a few minutes before closing time, but hours. Today, we visited a little after 5pm to find the dining room closed, the staff sitting inside, waving people to the line of cars in the drive through that  snakes around the building. On the occasion before last, they had closed the dining room and had no sides prepared and would not make them. Again, not a couple of minutes before closing but an hour and half before with 20 cars behind me in the drive through. Anyone can have a bad night. Maybe even two. But now it's looking like a trend."

Entered waffle house with a hangover. This is the first time I have ever actually eaten in the Waffle house, I have before only got drinks there. 

The table was dirty, with all sorts of trash left on there when we entered. It was very busy though. So I had eggs mushrooms and home fries and a OJ and a coffee. The coffee was really good, loved it! The home fries were greasy, soggy and generally rank. The mushrooms were oily.The eggs were good. They ran out of OJ so I could only get half a glass. 

Atmosphere was great, buzzy and divey. The service was over busy and stressed. Every table was full and the waiting staff seemed run off their feet. I felt sorry for them. 
 
I didn't expect them to run out of OJ and the food was super greasy. that said I could see myself eating there again, only to berate myself afterwards with the ""why did I bother"" feeling that I often get when trying to look on the bright side of businesses with that budget and divey feel.- which waffle house has in spades."

I really liked the horse theme. It is appropriately fitting for Belle Meade. Belle Meade Plantation had many successful thoroughbred studs, including Enquirer and Bonnie Scotland, whose bloodlines still dominate modern racing today. What a nice touch to add.

I did not have any trouble navigating the new location. It is very similar in placement of items like the Green Hills location. The store is also small enough where you can take once glance and head into the direction you need to get what you need to get.

Parking is busy. You're sharing it with a plaza that has several eateries, businesses and what not in your typical strip mall. Be mindful that it should be easier to maneuver than Green Hills parking lot as it is not as compact, but it still is super busy."

___________________________

I haven't been to Five Guys in a hot minute and was pleasantly surprised to see that the location that is near where I live now has handspun milkshakes. I think the true test of a good milkshake maker is based on a plain ol' chocolate milkshake. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised! They made it right in front of me, so I'm assuming it's all fresh ingredients-- it certainly didn't taste fake.

If you want to go outside the status quo milkshake they come with or without whipped cream in the following flavors (the first one being the one I'm afraid to try- but would love to hear a review of it!):
Bacon
Bananas
Cherries
Chocolate
Coffee
Malted Milk
Oreo Cookie Pieces
Oreo Cream
Peanut Butter
Salted Caramel
Strawberries

Obviously, Five Guys is known for their burgers and fresh-cooked fries, but thought I would highlight what makes this location special-- as the milkshakes are only offered at certain locations.

If you read any of the other reviews, they're spot on. 
What you see is what you get. 
Eat shell-on peanuts until you explode--or your food comes (service is pretty speedy so I wouldn't suggest getting more than one bowl of them).
Potatoes trucked in from a farm somewhere in the US (they write where they're from on a hanging sign-pretty cool-especially since they're never frozen!)
Fresh hamburger patties.
Decent buns for the size of the burger."

There are typically teenagers working there later in the afternoon and at night, some who are great, but others who apathetically take over 10 minutes to make your coffee while talking.

Despite these few lesser quality experiences, it's hard to complain when you've got a cup of Starbucks in your hand. :)"

First off this location is always packed.  A little too packed. I can never get a seat. Also I'm pretty sure there is a homeless shelter near by or something because I've been here 5 times and usually see people talking to themselves in the patio or hanging out around the location and have been asked for money on a few occasions.  Just makes the overall feel of this Starbucks just a little off. 

Also the bathrooms are always dirty and the super station is filthy. I don't know why I keep coming back here? Probably based on location only. I complain about this location on each visit!  I think I'm finally done though and will drive a little extra to avoid this location."

The food is always prepared well, never been to syrupy or too dry.  Its always clean and the line isn't every too long.  Of the Panda Express locations around, this one is my favorite.  

Specifically speaking to their service, while we were sitting, two women came in in a tizzy because they had thrown away one of their credit cards.  They knew exactly which can it was tossed into.  The management quickly called upon the specific associate that had emptied that can and he was able to go to the dumpster, and reclaim her credit card immediately.  I mean, it was actually quite impressive because he found it within a minute.  He knew exactly where to look.  I think it points to the organization and attention to detail that is ingrained in the team at this store and that is why their food is always just right.  love it."

I don't think I've ever had this happen in Tampa Bay, until this Anthony's location did it on Tuesday.

Tuesdays are generally one of my favorite days if I have an Anthony's craving, since they do half-price drafts and carry Peroni...but now they throw around some free food too?

Considering all the delicious options I've enjoyed at any Anthony's over the years (Pizza, Eggplant Marino, that hot roast beef sandwich, meatballs, wings), it has always been a sure thing to me.

Now that I've met Dara who manages this location and Jackie who tends bar, it will be tough to keep me out of here on Tuesdays for multiple reasons.

In a previous post about Side Splitters, I openly questioned why anyone attending a comedy show would order food there. Considering Anthony's is about 102 steps from the front door, that makes it a no-brainer in terms of having a quality dinner from an actual restaurant before or after someone like Gary Valentine mails in another set to pay his bar tab."

I've lived here for a few years and would visit the area before then. I would say two years ago the food was great and the service was too. Since then it has declined quickly. They spent what I would assume to be a fair deal of money on renovating the inside and outside of the building, but I guess they forgot to staff it with a staff that could hold up to its looks. Don't waste your time and money on the crap that they serve. Not that McDonald's is gourmet or anything, but you get my drift. Plenty of options are close by.

The last time we were here I ordered ribs platter that came with chicken, corn on the cob, fries and these pickles. I love pickles.. But these were horrible. One bite and it was a no go from there. Stay away from the ""special"" pickles.

Dimly lit lots of TVs hanging from above with long neck connecting ceiling fans up above. The massive wall of bottles behind the bar showed off the fancy bottles and large drink menu options. The server was very nice and gave me a slew of recommendations...

After placing my order she started me with the two bite size biscuits which tasted amazing... Small little bites of yumminess. Then I went with a cup of the gumbo and it was just okay. Tasted kind of muddy and the flavor was just okay and no shrimp in it just sausage... For the main course I went with the filet with scallops added and the steak was mediocre but dressed to impress. It just tasted more like a different cut of meat and was not all that flavorful, but would still win the beauty pageant just the cookie show lol...Then the scallops were 5 stars! They were very flavorful and would have been better just getting an order of these. Overall it was a just okay experience but I might venture back to experience just a scallops meal and try some oysters on another visit, but for now this experience left me wishing that my first place was not closed today..."

I asked for a larger piece and his response was it's only supposed to be a sample. Wow what a bad start. Told him it was cold and rubbery and he said it was probably off the top. That was it. Unbelievable. He asked me if I wanted to try something else so I asked for sweet and sour chicken. He told me he knew it was old and not very hot because it's not a popular dish. Passed on trying it. Appreciate the honesty but why keep something out there when ya know it's subpar quality!!? My meal was luke warm at best and not the quality of Nashville Panda Express. Staff really didn't seem to care and weren't very friendly. Not a very good start. Panda Express if ya think you'll get by on your name think again. Keep this up and word will get around. Hope ya improve by my next visit but I'm in no hurry to go back.

The cashier wasn't sure so she called the manager Joe and he came over. I explained to him what the worker said and showed him the price of $13.95. He tore the price tag off and said that is not the price. I told him that I wanted the item for 50% off the $13.95 and it was marked on the tag. He argued with me quite rudely and then he blurted out in front of the whole line of people, I can either take it for 50% off the $21 or not take it at all. He proceeded to throw it down on the counter and walk away very hostile. I told the cashier that I did not want it. Joe needs to learn customer service skills, and it is beyond me how he even ever became a manager. He was rude, obnoxious, cocky, arrogant and downright lacked any kind of professionalism whatsoever. I suggest that Petsmart train their managers better in the customer service field because obviously Joe had no skills or manners."

Twice in the last week I have been to this store and I am impressed. The parking lot is shady, which I enjoy. On both of my visits I was buying large quantities of paint. Like 20+ gallons at a time, in various colors. The gentlemen in the paint mixing section were literally the fastest paint mixers I ever saw. Both times. To compare, I got four cans at Lowe's the same week, and it took me at least fifteen minutes longer. 

Back at Home Depot, I walked around a bit while waiting for my paint, and every employee was friendly and asked if they could help me with anything. Wuuuuuuut. You can't even find employees at the HD in TnC. 

As great as the staff is at this location, I don't really like the store layout, or the parking lot layout. It's as if planning either of them was an afterthought, sticking stuff where ever it would fit. Also, I couldn't find the Veteran parking spaces at this location either.

But, I have gotten ""hi"", but the last time I went in, I didn't even get that -- more like ""what the fuck do you want?"" scowl.  To top it off, the sandwiches just weren't as well made as their normally are.

Add to that tonight's experience.  In a fit of dual household sickness and a sliver of laziness, we placed a delivery order.  It took over an hour (probably closer to 75 minutes) for it to show up.  Sure, the delivery guy said that they were slammed, but at the same time, when you've seen hundreds of those stupid Jimmy John's commercials where they act like they show up seconds later, 75 minutes is just too long, regardless of the number of orders.

Quite a few times the pizza was not completely cooked and there was still raw dough inside the crust. (It is my understanding that this is actually very unhealthy, to the point of being dangerous.) So the staff at Pizza Hut apparently find Pizza somewhat difficult, and complicated beyond their skill set. 

Just about the only thing I have positive to say about this place is that at least they give you metal forks.

I'd highly recommend you look to Chewy.com to auto-ship any pet items that you buy regularly.

Service is fine, and they have the expected stock of pet supplies for all kinds of animals.  Treats, toys, clothes, etc.  The employees are polite, but it's not like anyone has asked if I need help carrying heavy loads to my car."

Buy a salad spinner! Have been very disappointed on other weekends, so I'm done.
Sidebar, the location in Martinsville has been lousy even during the week. Last time I was there, about a year, the manager complained to me about how much money he loses on drink refills after I asked for one. That's BS. Soda is cheap for them. Hopefully he's been replaced."

They were extremely apologetic and since it was just a coffee, they didn't make me pay. It was very kind of them, and they have excellent customer service.

The set up was fast and kept everything at the right temp.  I would highly recommend using Chipotle to cater your party. Loved it! We ate left overs for several days!!

We won't be going back to Sonic for the breakfast, that's for sure. They did not do well on the drive home - wrapped in their foil lined paper, they became steamy and soggy and the bread was flat and unappetizing. The eggs were folded eggs and they were flavorless (zero seasoning), and remarkably the sausage was flavorless as well. The bacon was the only redeeming quality.

It's like the one daggy T-shirt that you love but can't throw away. It's comfortable, familiar, sort of average, but always there and always reliable.

Tonight we had a little wine, a little beer, spag-bol, veal marsala and soup. It wasn't fantastic, it wasn't the best Italian food ever, Otto was friendly...but a little slow, but what the heck...look at the above list of adjectives and you know why we went and why we will keep going back.

So our raw oysters were delicious. Cold, fresh and our attentive and sweet waitress made our cocktail sauce tableside. It was VERY tasty.

The food isn't the type of food I really enjoy, heavy and fried food.. average American food. The flavors isn't that bad, but I did find the pasta to be too salty. The onion rings were highly suggested and I don't even like onion rings, but these were so light and crispy! Delicious and they are also super cheap for such a large pile.

The Shepard's pie was average and the Cajun pasta was pretty good, but too salty for me. The serving was a large size.

I must have to say! The drinks were pretty cheap! If I were to return I would definitely go for the drinks and appetizers."

    To put the token in the lock to enter the restroom and to twist the handle to unlock the exit, be prepared to reach said lock at about 5'5"". 

Clean bathrooms 
Clean gas station

We waited to be seated while many tables were open. The hostess told us there wasnt enough servers to work the floor. The waitress took a while to take orders and drinks were often left empty for a few minutes before being filled. They also didnt provide any napkins other than the one they give you when you sit down. The food was good though so thats the reason for the two stars however I believe theres some sort of potato famine going on in PA because this is the second time and place I ordered fries with a meal and got a very small portion.

Perhaps the most anticipated opening since Mike Johnson's Hi-Pointe Drive-In (in our household, at least), this Shake Shack location does not disappoint.

To preface, I've had SS a few times traveling, mostly the LA location. It's reputation (looking at you, Aziz Ansari) and accolades are well deserved. This location differentiates itself by incorporating local flavors into its menu: Mound Burger (double with provel cheese), a Gooey Butter Cake concrete and even Fitz' Root Beer.

My SS go-to is a double Shake Burger with cheese fries. The burger is terrific: juicy, well seasoned and soft bun make it super easy to savor the flavor on each delectable bite. The fries are strong: krinkle kuts light and gently salted, but man o man is that cheese sauce on top amazing! If they sold it in stores, I'm certain it would have a strong clientele (hint, hint).

Now, I do have to mention the prices are a touch high for the root food here (burgers & fries), so be ready to spend. It's the main reason this isn't a 5-star review, but the quality is sublime and that's not even mentioning the shakes, chicken offerings or spirits available in-house (Legit with a capital ""L"", friends).

For our appetizer, we ordered the triple dipper and my brother opted for the southwestern egg rolls, crispy cheddar balls and chicken crispers. For our entrees, I got the ancho salmon with mashed potatoes and corn and he got the grass-fed sunrise burger, more so because of the bacon and fried egg on top. 

Service was really good and our waitress was very nice and accommodating, allowing us to use a free appetizer promotional code. However, the food was quite disappointing, which is why we won't be back again. My salmon was very bland, dry and overcooked with a handful of bones in it.

The first time I ordered from here, I ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni.  I got there five minutes after my ready time and had to wait another 10 minutes for my order.  When I got home and looked at the pizza, the cheese was patchy and there was barely any pepperoni on it; some pieces only had one piece or even half a piece of pepperoni.  Needless to say, I went on the Domino's website and complained.  A few days later, the manager called and was very sorry for the incident and offered me a credit.

A couple of weeks later, I took her up on the credit.  The difference was amazing.  I ordered the same thing and went to pick up.  It was ready when I got there and I was in and out in less than a minute.  The pizza was loaded with pepperoni and there wasn't one spot missing cheese.  I finished out the credit on another visit ordering a medium pepperoni and cheese bread.  The pizza, again, was amazing and the cheesy bread was outstanding, so good.  

I always get thin crust from Domino's, just because I'm not too crazy about their hand tossed.  The thin crust is exactly that, very thin, crispy, not too filling and if it's made right, delicious.  Pepperoni and cheese are good quality and never disappoint.  Papa John's thin crust is the only chain that rivals Domino's thin crust, but Domino's may just be slightly better.  And the cheese bread never disappoints.  You can hear the calories packing on, but it's well worth it.  Anyway, I'll definitely be going back to this Domino's many more times in the future."

My go to steak place was Temple Terrace Outback. However, I feel like the food quality there was gone down a bit.

Longhorn is on the surface similar to Outback. It has a dark wood look and similar cuts of steak.(They have the bloomin' onion renamed to Texas Tonion.)

Service: Great. I've been 2 times in the last 6 months. Both servers were affable and good at bringing out the food quickly.

Food: Im a creature of habit. I usually get a 16 oz prime rib with mashed potatoes. It was juicy, and cooked to medium like I requested. Probably not the best steak of all time, but for the price Its good enough.

Misc: It is a small thing, but I love that when you ask for A1 sauce here, they bring you a whole bottle. I dont know if its Outback policy now, but they just bring you a ramekin with sauce and you have to pester them to bring more. Is it a cost-saving feature? Lame. A1 sauce doesn't have gold or platinum in it last time I checked.
For prime rib , in addition to au jus, they have a nice creamy sauce that sort of tastes like horseradish-based sauce. 

Negatives: I ordered a Mango Margarita, but it was pretty weak. It tasted like Mango Lemonade from Genghis Grill. It was pretty at least.

Overall: A good choice for a moderate priced steak meal for the New Tampa/USF area."

But this night it was our selection, and amazingly enough it was an excellent choice. It was a Monday evening during dinner hour, the place was half full, so the noise level was low, and we were able talk easily. 

We sat at a booth in the bar area, and our server was there as soon as we sat down, took our drink order and was back in a flash with the drinks. She was very talkative and in a great mood. She really seemed to enjoy her job. 

Our food came out in a timely manner, and the server was always there as needed to check up on us. The chicken tortilla soup was very hearty, filled with lots of white chicken, veggies, and very little soup, ha. Many places give you lots of soup and very little chicken and veggies, this was the opposite. And it tasted great!

The grilled salmon and broccoli was cooked perfectly, tender, pink, and melted in your mouth. This dining experience really made me take a 2nd look at Outback, as I rarely give 5 stars to chain places, but I could not think of any reason this place did not deserve 5 stars. Food, service, ambiance, cleanliness of the restroom and entire restaurant was excellent, and we even had very close parking.

I believe I got one of their hoagies called ""Triplets"" which had chicken steak, beef steak, and ham for the meat plus some cheese. I was able to add lettuce and tomatoes at no extra cost in addition of choosing which cheese I desired.

I enjoyed their touch screen system and the general cleanliness of the station. They even have the touch screen soda machines that I have only seen at movie theaters. After I paid at the cashier, my sandwich was ready within five minutes and was only around $6 for the filling sandwich. I split it into two meals. It's a good value in my eyes.

Overall, I would definitely recommend trying Wawa sandwiches and going inside the store! I can't wait until my next chance to try one of their hoagies."

I don't know when First Watch came in, but it came in where Outback Steak House used to be. I am not a meat and potato type of person so I was a bit intrigued to see ""healthish"" restaurant here. 
Interior is very open with semi open kitchen. I initially liked the open space concept (seems like more and more places are following this design model), but as soon as we were seated I quickly realized the noise level (ie music, conversations from other customers, and dishes/utensils clattering). Some people may not be bothered by all these noises, but I felt like I had to talk so loud to be heard and it got tiring. 
Our server was a little interesting (made me feel a bit uncomfortable), however, he did his job so I cannot truly complain about this. The food took a bit longer to come out than other brunch places, and I was mildly irritated, most likely from being hangry. Once the food finally arrived the food was enjoyable. I would like to try other locations to just compare, but I probably may not go back to the Wayne location since it's not too convenient for me. If you are in the area I do recommend this place if you are looking for some healthy alternatives."

The location remains, the building is completely NEW !! 

I dig the interior's functional layout and double lane drive thru. This location is 24 hrs. 

The seating options here are cool. Up dated bench and stool seating and lounge couches. 

The design concept is warm, dare I say earthy *gulp. Yes, I said it. Ordering and pick up counters flow in a functional manner. Table service is available.

It has been awhile since we have been to McDonalds, certainly less since adopting a plant based diet. Muriel, the GM greeted my son immediately. Commenting on how much he'd grown. I asked about Vegetarian options, currently Mcdonalds offers few. Muriel, shared that the company is looking to release new menu options by the end of 2019. 

As my son finished his meal, which was accurate and prompt, an employee brought him a piece of celebration cake. Simultaneously, a group of team members were clapping and singing happy birthday, to a team member. 

It was kind of, a hekk-of-a-day at McDonalds. Ha!

If your team can be calm, timely and accurate during the madness of a grand opening. I expect regular service days, will be a breeze.

Who gives McDonalds, five stars - me. Muriel and her team have repeatedly earned it, I am sorry I did not review this location sooner !"

All Walgreens are basically ""like omg! I'm a soccer mom who lives in a beautiful suburban house! I have 3 beautiful boys! Their names are, Hunter, Jackson, and Quinn! They're my babies!""

Does that give you an idea how different downtown Walgreens are vs one that are literally on EVERY CORNER, IN EVERY CITY! hahahahaha!
Regardless, Walgreens is homey. I love going in at night time. Reminds me of when I'd go shopping with my mama as a wee boy and before driving back out to the house...she'd say, with her NYC accent ""I need to stop at Walgreens. I have a coupon for the diet Pepsi Pepsi thats on sale""  haahaha!
And even now, I LOVE going in there with her. Its quality time with, ma!

A lot of people rating this place need to be humbled to be honest lol. Most of the people at ANY fast food place are kids who've never worked before, understaffed and forced to make 10-15 orders PLUS take front counter orders PLUS keep track of drive through. Is it really their fault that they're doing their best under the circumstances? This isn't a 5-star bed and breakfast... it's FAST. FOOD. Their job is to get you your food FAST so they can get to taking and making the next person's order. Some people just like to complain until they're the ones in the same boat lol. Grow up. If you've ever seen a cash register there are likely a million and one buttons you have to leave how to use- through experience. Reducing someone's trial + error to ""fiddling"" around on a cash register is basically the same as an upper level manager looking at you like you're an idiot the first few times you try to give them a report they've asked for- Only to be insulted for being new, inexperienced, and having to figure things out little by little... I think a lot of y'all just don't enjoy your day jobs and want to take out your aggression on a bunch of retirees and preteens you've decided to look down on for earning an honest amount of money.

This came with regular fries. We also ordered a side order of onion rings. Which by the way are totally prepared in house, sliced, battered, and fried. Our choice of beverage tonight was a chocolate milkshake.

Well I've got to say everything was very good. My burger was juicy, the fries decent, onion rings good. The chocolate shake was fine also.

The corn on the cob sounds elaborately made, but didn't sound as standoutish  as it sounded. Fries, so salty, too salty for me!  Corn bread was dry.

The waitress that greeted us was chipper and very nice. I didn't expect that in a holiday. She asked us for a drink/appetizer order. We were not ready, and she was back within 5 minute. Very commendable. 

I ordered the Patron Margherita and my wife ordered the the special 'deep eddy' strawberry marg. Both were strong and delicious. 

For dinner the kids had 2 x the 2 for $25 that included an appetizer or 2 salads, one of many entrees with 2 sides, and a shared deserts. One dinner 3 for $10 which is basically the same, but includes a drink.  Wife and I shared 3 meat fajita platter with chicken, steak and shrimp. The kids chose:

Chips and guacamole 
2 salads
Sirloin steak
2x Margherita grilled chicken
Bacon cheese burger
1/2 rack ribs
Cheese cake 
Pan cookie
Sides included: fries, loaded mash, lots of steamed broccoli, more broccoli...

First off, guacamole was quite delicious. They didn't have that fake powdery or watery style that you find in a lot of restaurants. There were real, large chucks of fresh avocado. The salads were standard. 

The salads and appetizers arrived really quickly, the dinner took abit more time. That is expected on Easter Sunday.  
 
The ribs were perfect, Tender and Smokey. The 'just Bacon' Burger was HUGE and cooked perfect. The fries were fresh. The meats for fajita were grilled and spiced really nice. 

The desserts arrived timely and both baked Cookie with ice cream and cheese cake were good. Not great but good. 

Overall the food was excellent, service great, price was amazing for the quality and quantity of food given. We will come back.

Does this make sense to anyone else out there? When I questioned them they had a dismissive attitude. I went to other DD in the area asking for the same sandwich and it cost about half of what this DD charged me. I went back to this DD two more times and ordered the sandwich to see what they would charge and each time I was over charged but at a different price. Again when I tried to show them how odd this was I wasn't treated in a fair way. 

Also, the guy at the window in the morning will NEVER voluntarily give me my change. I think this is a ridiculously rude practice. I will tip if I feel it necessary, don't assume I don't want my change. It's MY money. 

I used to be a daily customer but have not been back in a long time. 

Terrible way to run a business."

Staff was too busy visiting with friends at the bar and taking cigarette breaks while also breaking tons of glassware accidentally. On two separate occasions large amounts of glasses were broken met with the cheers of the patrons in the bar.

To have to wait fifteen minutes for a sandwich and coffee when only one party was in front of me is beyond unacceptable.  It's not the staff that is the problem - it's the owner who is responsible. There are not enough people working here, that's obvious to everyone.  He should have his butt working here to serve his customers if he is short handed.  Don't give me the excuse you can't hire anyone, you are burning out your current employees and will be in a bigger jam.  The reason you can't hire is because you are not paying enough - pretty obvious.  If you can't staff your restaurant and provide the service customers expect you have no business owning a restaurant.  If you are not reading these reviews you don't know the first thing about running a business. You can be sure I will never be returning and will be spreading the word about this to neighbors.

1) your order will be wrong

2) you bill will be wrong

The staff is very friendly and at ease.  Great smiles!!   I find it a very relaxing atmosphere. The food is very good.
I order my eggs and meal a particular way and the staff never bat an eye while taking my order.
One of the waitress's is going to school for art and she draws the specials in nice, inventive drawings on the huge chalk board hanging from the ceiling.  
Just another nice small thing that adds to the overall relaxing and welcoming atmosphere that keeps me coming there at least once a week."

I stopped at Wendy's today out of sheer laziness. I didn't want two cross over to more intersections. So I suppose when I boycott someplace, don't take it too seriously. 

Wendy's has apparently revamped their menu a bit. They don't have new products per say but they are offering them in a different manner- and this girl isn't complaining. 

I'm down with the Asian boneless chicken nuggs- larger versions of the dollar menu counterpart- a little pricey but reeeeeal good. I also ordered the Baja salad which is basically a TexMex salad with a side of their (day old hamburger) chili. We'll see about that one.

As far as the staff? What else is new? The drive through speaker sucks- coupled with the lunch rush weedwacking- triple score, right? Ugh.

I really like their garden center and more often than not find what I'm looking for. The tropical and succulent area is fairly small but has a nice selection as well. 

The patio furniture is nicely displayed with an assortment of outdoor rugs, pillows with oodles of lawn and garden decor from lanterns to statues.

We pop in this location often to pick up those unexpected items homeowners find they need. We've had good luck in the paint department, building supplies, patio, lawn and garden department, hardware, lighting and seasonal area. Homeowners know how many little projects pop up quickly so it's easy to be in here, or similar location, weekly. Lowes is the closest home improvement store so we are here often.

Where once there were fresh faced kids, filled with glowing good health and optimism,  serving the ubiquitous Big Mac, there are now sad looking, out-of-shape, ageing pessimists flogging a poorer quality of fare.

I ordered fries, soda, a double quarter pounder and an apple pie. The fries were barely warm, as was the apple pie, and the burger seemed oilier than usual. I truly wish McDonalds would revitalize its attitude toward business. Happy kids trump aged has-beens any day when it comes to appealing to the hungry masses. Cleanliness is never out of fashion and a fresh food, rather than rancid oil, aroma does wonders for one's appetite.

I will continue to patronize McDonalds on occasion, but my loyalty is being sorely tested by the general very poor quality of the marque is my local area.

It's tragic and Mr Mac needs to extract his digit and get the chain back on track. I want to say the whole experience here is... um...shitty. But saying something is shitty, is somewhat... er...shitty. So ....what the hell, it's SHITTY...with a capital 'F'.

So there!"

1) My grandpa is really, really old, over 90 years
2) My dad has been in/out of the hospital, fighting some stuff, recently
3) You have to impress me pretty hard as a fast food chain to get above/below three stars

This Taco Bell has been the one I've gone to since it opened.  It is right down the street from my parent's house, and has always been convenient.  My experiences have mostly been average to above average.

However, my old grandpa recently went into this fine establishment to get burritos for my frail father after he returned from the hospital.  The workers at this Taco Bell helped him through his ordering process patiently, gave him advice on what to get, and offered to help him out to his car with his food.  They did everything they could, to make sure my grandpa could bring my dad the burrito that he was looking forward to having.

This type of service, especially at a time like this, really ingratiated me to this location.  The burritos seemed like they were made with extra care, and the patience they showed was really amazing.  Fast food is fast food, but it is the way that that food is delivered and presented that separates certain locations from others.

p.s. I am not trolling.  This is a true story!"

I flew up here after being chased away from hurricane Irma in Florida. So I am visiting family and going to local Planet Fitness locations. After visiting locations in 4 different states, I think I can confidently say this is one of the largest gyms of the bunch - regarding actual real estate. Lots and lots of cardio equipment and all the weights/machines are super clean and were periodically cleaned by staff. The staff all were super nice and..... honestly, this is one of my favorite locations of all I have visited! I went in early afternoon (when most people are working) so I was close to the only one in the gym. So I cant review the actual energy of the place. A good gym needs good positive energy. But from everything I saw and experienced, it does have it, and wonderful locker rooms and amenities, and if I lived in the area -- I would be proud to call it my home gym. 5 stars!"

I have to say they did a rather decent job of putting together this supermarket which has only been open maybe a week or so. I hope they keep it as nice as it is now.

There is just about everything you could ask for in a compact space which seems more spacious once you enter. They have all the regular sections of any full-service supermarket like dairy, produce, meats, fruits, and the like. They must have a small kitchen because they were giving out free samples of ""fake"" chicken Chicken Tikka Masala which was quite good and also free samples of Halloween gummies, which I did not take.

The store had a whole wall of packaged and prepared soups and salads like pasta salad. I ended up purchasing some of the soups (pictured below) and had some of the Chicken Soup for lunch today. Not bad at all.

All staff interactions were pleasant and accommodating. Quick, too.

I'm taking one star because the store did not have non-grocery products like Tupperware or utensils. No drugs or paper here, either, that I didn't see. Maybe the TJ philosophy is not to have these products? Anyway, I like this place."

I have done this to make absolutely sure that this criticism is directed towards the correct store. This specific Domino's has some of the worst pizza I have ever had the distinct displeasure of tasting. The thin crust pizza has the texture of slightly malleable plastic, and every pizza I've ordered has been extremely dried out. 

I've ordered multiple times from this establishment, because when I was at college I had the misfortune of being serviced by a Domino's that was wildly inconsistent. The location here does not lack consistency; in fact, it appears to churn out the most consistently terrible pizzas I have ever witnessed in my life.

As commented on by an earlier reviewer, the real tragedy here is that the extremely amiable, likable, and courteous delivery people have to bring these shameful creations to paying customers. I wish the delivery people the very best, despite the fact that the quality of food produced by this store clearly shows that the inside of the store cannot be bothered with the basic decency of quality control.

The message clearly communicated to the customer is that someone either doesn't care, is incompetent, or both. I sincerely hope things change so that people spending ~$16 to have a relaxed night of pizza with friends/family will no longer be perpetually disappointed."

I understand times are tough with Covid, however, I feel that Panera really can't provide a real excuse when almost everything on their menu comes in bags and for most of the time is frozen. Plus, why should I spend over $50 there for my family to be told we are out of various items once you get there. So I took it upon myself to call their headquarters number.

The fries are delicious, too!  They are cut with a medium thickness, fried in peanut oil, and always fresh.  I like how they drop a few extra fries in the bag.  It's like the bonus fry, only there's 15 of them! 

The price is more than you'll pay at most other fast food restaurants, but in my opinion, the food is better also.  They've opened over 1000 locations to date, so they're doing something(s) right!

I think all their steaks are quality so feel free to go for what you like. I liked the Porterhouse T-bone medium done and the chili. The Sirloin looked juicy as well so I do t think you can go wrong. 

Take your time ordering because the staff will get you out of here as soon as they can, especially if it is busy and there's a line on the weekends. 

Great selection of draft beers here as well. They have all the basics, PBR, Miller Lite, and Bud. They also have Goose Island IPAs here too."

From speaking with the technician on this trip I learned they have fully re-staffed this location.  I'm assuming because of the errors I have listed above. I mean if it happened to me, it happened to people of importance and then it mattered.

On this trip I got a semi-tire rotation, oil change and cabin air filter change on my 2015 Hyundai Sonata all totaling $142.65.

One night at around 3am, I was one of 6 people in the gym. One was an employee, the other a janitor, and the rest were patrons. I went into the bathroom, had just finished showering, came out in my towel and went to the mirror. I was lucky enough to have the janitor come up behind me and watch me for about 2 minutes. He did not announce himself, just strolled into the bathroom and stood there watching me. I did not know how to react; I am the type of person that freezes up and goes blank in unexpected, intimidating situations. I finished combing and putting up my hair and by that time he had gotten his fill of me and walked out.
I reported it to management, even called the headquarters. Their response was abhorrent and their treatment worse. In the end, they told me they would cancel my membership and they were KIND ENOUGH to waive the cancellation fee, and they made sure to tell me they were doing ME a favor.

Ridiculous, unprofessional and beyond abysmal treatment."

My family of four ate for about $40: two small burgers, two reg size burgers, one order of fries, and four soft drinks.  Not a bad value.

The burgers are cooked medium-well.  I do not know if they honor requests for those of us who prefer their burgers rarer.  The burgers are quality, but the toppings are the main attraction at this place.  They have over a dozen to choose from, and they don't charge extra for any of them.  The fries are very good, and you get a lot of them.  Seriously.  The four of us shared a regular size, and it was ample.

For anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing dining experience, get your food to go.  It's a no-frills establishment, but they have a relaxed and friendly demeanor.  

I would probably rate Five Guys somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but the quality of the fries and the quantity of the burger fixins push it up to a 4."

I mean this with utmost respect because I love this restaurant: They just need to pace themselves, and give each and every customer their undivided attention. 

We are rushed through such short lines. Just a couple of folks could be waiting, and it's as if the line is out the door. They're friendly enough but never ask ""would you like anything else?"" before shoving the food aside to help the next person. I almost always want something else they have right in front of them that wasn't offered to me. 

When my friend ordered a quesadilla, she chose her meat and the thing vanished. They cooked it before she could say ""and veggies, please."" They moved onto the next person in line, she was pushed aside and had to ask the cashier to add her veggies. Again, the line was so short and the store wasn't closing for hours. 

There's fast and efficient, and there's fast and sloppy. Paying better attention to customers needs will prevent little mistakes from happening, and will add stars to reviews.

Side note: They've been skimping out on the meat portions lately, making it necessary for me to order double meat. I've never ordered double meat before."

This Subway seems to do a better job than the others I have been to.  The staff was friendly and the bread seemed fresh.  If you read the business news you know that a lot of the Subway franchises have been complaining that they are losing customers, since the cut down on their choice of breads, and how many times a week they get deliveries of fresh bread.  They seem to be headed for financial trouble.

I can understand, and it was probably a good thing that it was a slow Sunday afternoon, and not in the middle of a rush.

My order has never been made wrong, and I like the nice sleek lines of the counters, tables and chairs here. The drive thru line is clearly marked and separated, so there is no confusion about if you are in the line or not, and no way to cut in, which is nice.

I am sure the kinks are still being worked out, it just doesn't seem like they are 100% yet. I am sure they will improve with time. I am so sure that being a barista is not the easiest job in the world, and pretty thankless."

The board menu has changed, I guess to make it easier for first time guests. It just messed me up because I accidentally ordered tacos on their own without the refried beans. I always thought they had the best refried beans, but based on my carne asada and shrimp tacos I'm not so sure anymore. 

The tacos were missing flavors that used to blow my mind several years ago. Now, they're just tacos you can eat to satisfy hunger. Not worth the price and the drive.

I'm putting consideration into the type of establishment I visit (i.e., chain restaurant, burger joint, fine dining, etc.).  No one would claim that a five star fine dining restaurant is comparable to a five star Belgian bar experience.  The two just aren't the same yet they could both arguably score the same amount of stars based on what one would expect from an experience at either place.  Know what I mean?  

That said, Bahama Breeze is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I've been to the location in Cherry Hill probably 10 times or more.  In the beginning, service was pretty slow and waits were long, but they have picked up over time and aren't as unorganized as they once were.  

Food is consistently good.  I usually alternate between the grilled chicken and veggies over greens and the jerk salmon or grilled tilapia.  Last night I had the jerk salmon with cinnamon sweet potato mash.  Fried plantains and a big serving of mango salsa were served alongside.  Yum.  Their mojitos are always the same; generously sized and with enough kick to give me a buzz off of one!"

You can opt for veggies (celery and carrots) instead of fries, which is also a plus.

I was not impressed with the mild flavor wings. Practically flavorless to me, especially compared to the others. The garlic parm wings taste more like butter parm. Not bad but not great. I am also disappointed that they don't deliver, though takeout is an option.

I recently went in to this branch to check out laminate flooring. Well I didn't find exactly what I wanted, I found they had a pretty decent selection and attractive prices. On the way out one of their sale displays caught my eye and I wound up buying a power drill set that was offered at an unbelievable price. Throughout the store actually, the prices were as great as you'd expect from a big box store, comparable to Lowes, and much better than what you'd find at Ace. 

On the downside, there are a few things that bug me about this place. I think their lack of Wi-Fi, in an area that's known for terrible cell phone coverage, is really unacceptable in this day and age. While trying to check out products and reviews on their website, I noticed I had zero bars (thanks Verizon). So without store Wi-Fi, not an uncommon thing today, I had no way to connect and check what I was looking for. More than once I've had to walk out and shop elsewhere because I wasn't able to get the information on a product that I needed.

Also their bathrooms are absolutely revolting! I had to take my kid into one, and we are both mortified at the state of it. It's almost 2020, nobody should have to use a store bathroom that smells like the plague and looks like a sewer pipe exploded. It's just really disgusting and unacceptable. They should really be ashamed for making customers and employees use a facility like this."

It's sometimes called the sad sound effect.  Well now that I've set up this awesome segue there is absolutely nothing sad about this great Wawa.

In the world of Wawa's there are several flavors.  This one is usually called a ""Super Wawa"" because it's huge and has the gas pumps outside.  When it comes to convenience stores it doesn't get much better than this.  

I've been to the Wawa near my home in Havertown hundreds of times and this one is near where I work.  There are reasons they ""own"" the convenience store business in this part of the country and this one is a great example.

* 24/7
* Great gas prices with cash and credit the same price.
* Lottery
* Inexpensive tasty coffee products.
* Custom made fresh sandwiches that are decent especially at odd hours when everybody else is closed.
* Refrigerated products that are always ""in code.""
* A management team that cares.

Be warned that they get crazy busy but the handle the crowds well."

This was a madhouse. I'm glad to report that they do have someone standing at the door to make sure everyone entering wears a mask. Once inside the store it's a total free for all. I wandered with a total ""omg panic what am I doing"" look on my face for what seemed like forever. I couldn't find a single employee anywhere. 

The store itself was well stocked, I've heard rumors of hardware stores being pretty picked through during these pandemic days, but fortunately that was not the case. 

This is a Home Depot for weekend warrior experts only. If you're needing some help, I wouldn't recommend.

Every time we've gone the trash can is overflowing, one time an employee just piled more on and walked away.  They never have fajita veggies ready and act like I'm putting them out by wanting them.  Most of the employees throw you attitude, but some are nice.  Today I went in wanting the soup, the employee was rude to me from the start, showed me that they only had a little soup left and asked me if I still wanted it. I switched my order and she started slamming stuff around as she started to make it. I asked for fajita veggies which of course they were out of, and she told me they were out, with an attitude. I lost it, immediately left and will never go back to that location and probably not to any Qdoba ever again. There's no excuse for their consistent terrible service.

When you break down the nutrition facts and compare the new Egg White to the Regular McMuffin, there really isn't that much of a difference. You save 50 calories and 5 grams of fat ordering the EW. Ordering the regular Egg McMuffin you lose 1 gram of fiber and get 20 mg less of Sodium. If you count points on the Weight Watchers program, a regular McMuffin is 8 points and the new Egg White is 7. One point is not that big of a savings. The egg whites and white cheddar is not exclusive to the McMuffin, you can try it on any egg & cheese sandwich. Which means, you can have it your way.

Only one time did we run into an interesting situation. I stood near the picture window to watch because my fur baby is a bit of a jackass and like to run out the front door. Yes, only the front, so once the tracker said the delivery was on its way, I went to watch. The driver came the wrong way through the cul-de-sac and sat in front of my house for a good 2-3 minutes and left. He didn't come back for another 10-15 minutes. By then our food was lukewarm but we were starving. I can honestly say that this has only occurred once. Every other time, our order has been piping hot--literally right out of the oven. Everything has been delivered accurately and on time (usually early!) Every business can have an off day. It happens. Humans are involved in the process. For me, it's more about how they fix a mistake rather than holding them to a standard of never making them. You won't find constant mistakes here. They're few and far between. I have to say, when I allow myself to order pizza, the Wisconsin Six Cheese is ridiculous!! It's so good. The Mediterranean Veggie sub is so good, and my family loves the Brooklyn crust. The new Parmesan bites are killer. Possibly literally because they're doused in butter, but on an indulgence night...mmm holy delicious!"

Brophy Bros. is a Santa Barbara landmark and usually stop in when we are in the area. They open at 11 am and is constantly packed with locals and tourists. The main dinning room / bar is not large and they do have outside seating on the terrace with a bar downstairs too. Brophy Bros. is a seafood raw bar restaurant and IMO has the best clam chowder in Santa Barbara. Its chunky with tons of chopped clams. On our recent visit we ordered the following:

Seafood combo comes with ceviche, shrimp, oysters and clams
Little Neck clams on the half shell
Fried Calamari
A big bowl of the clam chowder.

The raw clams and oysters were very fresh and the hot fried calamari was excellent. The ceviche was however hard to eat spread out on the iced seafood combo plate. 

The restaurant is loud and high energy. There is parking spaces around the restaurant but they are hard to come by. So there is a large City parking lot right next to the center."

Everyone in the store is very helpful as well. Upon coming to vet today we had to wait for a room to be ready which is totally normal so we walked around. The staff was great and friendly and loved our little Boston terrier. We then went over to the groomer side to see the doggies since we are very dog friendly. We noticed one of the dogs screaming and sounding like he was in the pain. The groomer who was trying to cut his nails was being very forceful with grabbing at his feet. She then yelled in his face to shut up and stop it. He continued to scream in pain and she continued to be mean to this poor doggie. I did make a complaint to the vet and I hope they fixed the situation but I also hope she doesn't have her job much longer. If that was my dog I would of lost my mind on her.

  The food is not the issue - its good hoagie-type sandwiches, made to order.  The problem is I had an identical experience to J.B. with regard to credit card theft.   While I could not PROVE it happened there, here is why I am certain it did:  I was out of the city for 6 weeks.  I returned home on March 16.  I used my credit card TWO times between March 16 and March 17, once at my super market and once at JimmyJohns.  That afternoon I got the dreaded ""fraud call"" from my credit card company.  There were 3 bogus charges, all in the suburban Philadelphia area.  While I suppose it could have been stolen on line and just by random chance was used in this area, the odds are against it.  I stopped in to JimmyJohn's the following week to discuss it  and the woman who identified herself at the manager couldn't care less.  Not the least bit interested.  
  There's a serious issue here with regard to the people who work there and credit card theft, and the company should address it.  Meanwhile, customers be warned!"

Red Lobster is gonna pretty much be the same Red Lobster anywhere you go - the night I went to this one a couple months ago was a good one (which I'm thankful for because I needed a good atmosphere as I was having the ex sign the divorce papers that night.)

The food was tasty as to which I'm accustomed - of course I have narrowed my selection at Red Lobster (wherever it may be) down to one entree - Crab Linguini Alfredo - love it. There's never a doubt it will be good, and who doesn't love the cheddar bay biscuits? Throw in a li'l garden salad w/bleu cheese and I'm good to go.

The service I had here this night was excellent. The waitress (hey, why is it okay to say ""waitress"" but not okay to say ""stewardess""... or is it... I'm getting sidetracked...) was very attentive, but not overly so, very polite, and on top of everything. She earned a nice tip from me that night. And the ex mentioned quite a few times how pretty she was... (hey, was she trying to tell me something there...) Anyway, while I agree the girl was attractive, I acted as if I didn't really notice... this is what I do...

We enjoyed our meals, had great service, I got the papers signed, that's at the least a 4 star night, no? I'd definitely go back if I was in Philly, in a Crab Linguini Alfredo mood, and wanted to reminisce on divorce papers... oh wait... no, I'd still go back."

They certainly aren't 'gourmet' as some people would consider the word, but there are a lot of scrumptious options to choose from. I've tried several of them, and they are all delicious, juicy and super filling. And come with unlimited fries! There are chicken burgers and veggie burgers, but why bother? I've always wanted to order one of those towers of onion rings that are always sailing past... The milkshakes are really good, too. Prices are very reasonable, usually around $12 for the burger + unlimited fries. Nothing not to like about that. 

This is definitely a family friendly restaurant, and as I don't have any kids and don't like waiting for a spot in the dining room, I always sit in the lounge. There are many TVs playing sports all around. I was there last night and they must have been playing a combo of Dance Mix '96 and the Night At The Roxbury soundtrack. Loudly. It was amazing. You're pretty much guaranteed to hear Happy Birthday from the other side of the restaurant every time you come here. Most of the staff are usually really young to pretty young. Waitresses and hostesses are always cheerleader upbeat, and waiters are always goofy and friendly.

The book rang up full price so I mentioned it to Henry and he called over one of the ""top leaders"" Dylan I'm pretty sure is his name. I told him the price was ringing up full price and he replied that the 20% off was taken off the retail value $16, which clearly doesn't add up 16-2=14 not 12. And so I show him the cartwheel app with the correct price. He looks up at me and gives me this super creepy stare then has Henry ring it up for $9.59 but with a very rude tone.

And I know like some places have been understaffed. But really what contributes to the long wait is that the fact that every time I've gone through KFC to get food is that they have us pull around to the front. And then they tell us I'll bring the food out. It's quite frustrating because I feel like they do it to move the line. When it comes time though to bring the food out. The employees are super confused. They have a difficulty in finding the car that had ordered this order. They are walking all over the parking lot trying to find the owner of who ordered this order. And I think it is really inefficient and time consuming. If they are trying to find the owner who ordered the food at least put the car make color etc. for the employees down. Because it seems like it causes a lot of confusion and waste a lot of time especially for employees.

We know the reason they do this is to make money----You could probably go to a hardware store and save money but they aren't as convenient and in your face like the big chains so we end up swinging in here when you are out running errands and taking care of business.  

The worker made it clear that this is a Do-it-yourself store for people that don't know what they are doing so they package things in kits......and they also made a comment insinuating that we were not capable of figuring it out if we didn't have a kit....Yeah my husband isn't an electrician or a contractor by trade but I would trust him to build an entire house from top to bottom by himself if need be.....

Cheaper... but cheap doesn't work. Spend more so you don't waste more time to replace essentials. Both staffs were extra nice & helpful to me. 

By the way, I love the homes around here. $$$$ Yes there are expensive homes in Philly but you just gotta know where to find them. Me... I want easy access to the highway being one of the top priorities and this location is it. Intersection of two or three major highways is very close by. Maybe one day I can own a home here.  Right by my Home Depot and everything else is like a hop and a skip away- ultimate convenience!"

Joe offered awesome service and suggested some NEW pub pretzels with beer cheese. Wow those were a hit. I had the Napa chicken which was on the under 550 calorie menu and it was chicken with a wine sauce and a pile of nicely grilled vegetables. Great flavor. Happy hour is great too from 3-6 pm and 9-close. The manager was visible and the atmosphere was very friendly.

She is loud was screaming and upset our dog as well.  My 17 year old daughter has been picking our dog up for many months now and for the first time this morning Christi screamed that she has to be 18 to pick up the dog and they won't let her anymore including today.  Suggestion Christi- not a good way to treat customers.

It may not have as large of a collection of things in some departments as the stores in STL, but I am still fulfilling my needs. I was surprisingly surprised when I found all the accessories I needed for redoing the bathrooms in my new home. The colors of the towels offered, were a perfect match to my paint. I will also admit, I have purchased several items from their Magnolia department. I guess I am watching to much HGTV. 

What surprises me the most about myself, is I am shopping the grocery area more then I did in STL. It is so easy to just pick-up some items here and there instead of having to stop at the grocery store, too. The quality is pretty much the same and also not much difference in price. 

I've said it before and I'll repeat myself, the customer service here is pretty damn, good. The sales associates on the floor are very helpful and the cashiers are quick and friendly. 

Glad to bump them up to a well deserved 5 Stars.

One co-worker got a half-salad/half-sandwich combo. She ordered the grown-up grilled cheese which with bacon, supposedly. When she opened the sandwich to check that there was bacon there was about a half teaspoon of crumbled bacon sitting in on one end of the sandwich. We brought this up to the manager who responded - ""The sandwich should come with a half tablespoon of bacon, if you want more bacon just ask next time."" But there wasn't a half tablespoon of bacon so... The salad, which came with avocado also, apparently, came with the avocado peel. Yay fiber! Manager's response: ""Oh."" There was a giant cookie though. For free. Delish.

Another co-worker got a half-salad with soup & a roll. Her roll had a hair on it. Manager's response: ""My eyes are bad so I can't see it, but I trust you"". Then she walked away. Again, giant cookie!

Co-worker #3 also ordered the half-salad/soup with French onion soup. She got tomato soup. Co-worker #3 called one of the employees over to inform him that the soup was wrong, he says, ""No, the receipt says you ordered tomato soup. ... But let me take it back for you."" Giant cookie!

My turkey & avocado BLT required re-assembly in order for me to actually pick it up and eat it without everything falling out. Once assembled it was okay. Giant cookie!
If you're going to make sandwiches for a living, make them well. If you're going to manage people who make sandwiches, care about the customers who eat them (the sandwiches). I didn't get that vibe at Panera. The baked goods, though, amazing (see: giant cookie). Perhaps Panera should just stick to being a bakery, not a bistro."

I noticed I go to this Panera a lot, mostly for it's super convenient location. Parking in the back isn't great but you'll eventually find something. 

Some of my favorites are the Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich, French Onion soup and the coffee cake ring. Who am I trying to kid? I love all pastries. Newly discovered favorite side dish, the mac & cheese. Tastes like Stouffers from back in the day; it's creamy & delicious.

Their baguettes are fantastic, but I usually get the apple as my side and going to say, you need to do better on finding these apples. I love the size, but sometimes they are mealy. Get a good, crisp, mini apple and you've got a customer for life.

When it's busy, I get it, but I personally haven't had a moment where I'm fuming mad. Get some lemonade and patiently wait for your tasty meal to be ready."

My response, ""That was the plan, but you clearly have no place for me to sit. So, I'll take it with me and get out of here.""

I thought at 1:45pm on a Friday, the lunch crowd would be diffused. I swung in to use my calendar card for the May monthly perk (free grilled nuggets) after checking out the athletic apparel outlet stores.

Nope. The other Yelp reviews here are correct. I'm guessing this CFA is busy all the time...except overnights and Sunday of course.

Still there was a manager taking orders inside to help move the line and multiple people were outside trying to move along a very packed line of cars ordering at the window. 

These employees were doing their best, but this location just might be one to avoid if you like quick service and a quiet place to sit down for 15-20 minutes and eat.

I end this CFA review with another reference to how I regularly go to their original location just north of Atlanta airport because they have a specialty menu that features burgers, a steak sandwich and a ""Hot Brown."" It always blows people's minds when I tell them that...but it is 100% true. Yes, you can eat the cow mascot at the original Chick-fil-A. Right or wrong, I do it."

It was late and we were pretty darn hungry. Luckily Yelp led us here. We didn't know we wanted sausages but after we finished, I could have sworn we had had a craving for it.

FOOD (4 stars):
----------------
You must get the **Crawfish Etouffee Fries**, no way around it. They are just too good! Imagine: fully loaded potatoes just soaking up all that crawfish flavor. Mmm! 

The **Guinness Special** is an Irish Guinness sausage, andouille sauce, onions, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon, and yellow mustard. It sounded so appealing but ended up just being average. Exactly what you'd expect.

However, the winner in the sausage department was the **Alligator Sausage**! I was a little surprised since I just ordered it on a whim and to say we'd tried it while in NOLA. It's super flavorful on its own and didn't even need much sauce. Definitely preferred this to the Guinness Special. Winner winner, alligator dinner!

SERVICE/AMBIANCE (4 stars):
-------------------------------
Really chill vibe about this place. The whole Marigny district is this way in fact, so it's nice to sit upstairs by the balcony and people watch down onto the street. Upstairs there's a bar and an ultra zen Chewbacca, so go check him out. Servers were really chill as well and accommodating. Good experience overall.

TIP: Will meet all your sausage cravings.

DATE TIP: Check your date's adventurousness (or lack thereof). Put them to the test -- the power of the Gator sausage!"

(If your curious about my other favorite stop, I usually head the opposite direction on Rosa Parks to B&C BBQ at the Farmer's Market). The food is fresh and they move you through the line quickly...and that's important since there is ALWAYS a line wherever you go in MetroCenter at lunch. My favorite meal is the Cancro Special which isn't listed on the menu but is simply a roast beef & provolone sandwich with pepperoni on top. It is good cold, but if you have time, I recommend you order it hot, as a wrap, with onions, banana peppers, and chipotle mayo. If this seems far from your taste in sandwiches, the turkey is always a safe choice. 

One of the other nice things about this particular location is that they have a fruit tea that changes daily. In the hotter months, it is nice to be able to swing by and get a good fruit flavored tea that you can top off before you head out the door. 

The only thing that actually keeps me from giving this location five stars is the lack of their famous (in my mind) white chocolate and macadamia nut cookies. Every other Jersey Mikes I have been to have these, and I can only attribute their absence to the fact that these are franchise locations and therefore do have some choice in what they serve/carry (not every location has fruit tea either). However, if you do find yourself in another Jersey Mikes that carries these wonderful tasting, sugar shock inducing creations, I highly suggest you try one."

I did a mobile order and got a free pastry bc I signed up with an account on the app. My bbq chicken Mac n cheese was good but I asked for a bread bowl which I didn't get. It just came in a cup. I thought my bag was correct like it had everything in it but it looked like the bread bowl was in a box but then I realized the Mac n cheese was just in a cup when I got home. I guess that's my mistake and could of said something but i already left. But it's whatever I had a gift card and still have money on it so hopefully they don't mess it up next time.  Overall the food was good. The girl at the counter was nice and helpful as well. There's outdoor seating as well.

Barista's are supposed to be knowledgeable and friendly. I found the customer service to be mediocre at best. When I asked if they had specific flavorings for my drink, the barista had an attitude and said that it was a flavor that they did not carry. I'm 100% sure that caramel is a frequently used flavor at all Starbucks.

About a year ago I had a serious problem with an employee here. She was extremely rude and made comments about the food my two friends and I were ordering. The order was: three quesadillas, one family size mac and cheese, one smoothie, and one cookie.  There were two people working at the time and the store was filled with about 11 people. The woman behind the deli became so apparently overwhelmed, that she yelled at her manager that he didn't staff enough people, had the front door locked so no more customers would come in, and told my friends and I that we ordered too much (loudly, in front of other customers). 

The situation was entirely embarrassing. Upon reporting it to Wawa's website, I received a call almost immediately. The GM had me come in not only to give me full refund, but also to give me a 25 dollar gift card. He was apologetic and sincere, which is something I appreciate very much.

First of all, I am extremely harsh on sandwich shops with tuna as a selection; they never really appeal to my senses but Jimmy John's tuna on wheat is addictive. They are on the order with subway but on a more gourmet scale. Bread is always fresh with a very good wheat option. Cheese choices include provolone which made my sandwich extra especial. They also have sprouts to add to your order.! What really sealed the deal for me is the drive-thru. Employees are always well - mannered and professional even though they fast track; it's like an assembly line back there. Chips are fresh and healthier than the choices at subway.  JJ's also delivers to places in the area. 
This fresh gourmet sandwich concept is what the consumer appreciates. Especially Tuna Lovers like me!"

I stopped in here last Friday just after a severe thunderstorm and the place was packed.  Both the drive-thru and lobby were crowded with hungry people looking for a quick fix.  Additionally, the storm disrupted their POS terminal and it was taking roughly 5 minutes to process each credit/debit card, it was crazy.  Normally, in these situations, folks get hangry.  They begin huffin' and puffin', and in some cases just end up leaving.  Sherlyne wasn't having it though.  She kept the line moving as fast as possible, and was very personable with everyone who was waiting for their orders.  She kept a smile on her face the entire time despite the pressure, and she stayed engaged with everyone in the lobby and preparing food.  Seeing her in action was like watching an instructional video on customer service 101.  

I waited nearly 10 minutes for a Whopper meals and some Mac 'n Cheetos, but I didn't mind at all.  My food was piping hot, fresh and tasted great.  Well, except for those Mac 'n Cheetos.  One of those things that looks good on the drawing board, I guess.

Anywho, I hope this old BK get razed for one of the new designs and I hope Sherlyne gets promoted.  But because the place is so run down though, I have to give a 3-star."

I was in Nashville for a week recently and almost drove off the road when I saw this store on Mallory Lane. 

First off, I don't get the complaints about this place, I must have eaten here 5-6 times while I was visiting, and if anybody has a legitimate complaint, its my veg GF. She got sick of hearing me rave about Culver's, but its only a few blocks from her apartment, so just shut up and eat your salad honey.

The burgers here are out of sight, perfectly crispy and delicious, with just enough butter to get your attention. I tried a little of everything while I was in town, even a Rueben, and it was likewise up to NY deli standards. And the sweet potato fries, you got to try those, just fantastic. And there's a reason they slather hamburgers with butter in Wisconsin, cause its the best thing the dairy state produces! So as far as fast food goes, it gets five stars from me every day. 

Service: quick, friendly and accurate. 
Cleanliness: clean and neat appearance as well as clean bathrooms. 
Quality: every order is made fresh, there's nothing sitting around waiting for you. Piping hot fries burgers etc. Good quality food as well, makes for always a tasty experience. 
Value: fair prices for the great quality. Plus they offer text and email coupons.

Great place to grab lunch or dinner. They have a good sized menu as well as awesome frozen custard for dessert. If you haven't eaten here yet, all I got to say is....What have you been waiting for?"

It's on the east side of 295 and on the south side of Route 30. It is your classic super Wawa with the big store and many pumps.  However you cannot enter from route 30.   The entrance driveway is actually located behind the store. There's a service road that you have to turn into either right before or right after the store itself. Very strange but it works. This is probably why the gas here was five cents cheaper than the other super Wawas in the area.

I used self check out bc it was only one item and thought it would be quick. Usually when I scan my card all coupons come up. I clocked that I wanted to use my extra bucks and then the machine lit up like a slot machine. I had to wait a while to get help which is no big deal. The employee couldn't figure out what happened and he said since I didn't have proof of the coupon he couldn't do anything abojt it. I was frustrated but just left and was putting my child back in the car when I got the receipt emailed to me with the item I got and the proof of extra bucks. I went back into the store and said ""FYI I got a receipt and here's the proof that it was the machine and not me"" and he said FYI something else but without the actual coupon there was nothing he could do. He ended up reissuing the extra bucks and gave me my item. The employees were nice. The issue is that it's not my fault that there was a computer glitch.

The young lady taken my order replied with ""you want orange juice as your drink"" . I didnt feel like trying to explain so I said no make it sweet tea.

I checked in at 12:45pm for my haircut appointment at 1:15 pm. I reached there at 1:10pm.

I notified the lady who was handling the cash counter but she was not even bothered to fix it. Her argument was that it's not accurate. While other Supercuts locations are following the check in process diligently, this store is luring customers by showing them zero wait time and then asking them to wait for another 90 minutes and making accuses

I could've avoided this review but the lady was sitting idle and did not fix the issue when I notified her.

To the chic who was upset because the menu says ""gourmet sandwiches,"" I think you need a lesson in satire.  You obviously didn't see all the signs hanging up around the building that read, ""Customer is usually right"" or ""free smells"" etc.  Everyone knows there ain't nothing ""gourmet"" about JJ's subs, just like everyone knows McDonald's doesn't sell real hamburgers.  The menu is facetious.  

Unbelievable.

I guess I've eaten at this particular location 5 or 6 times since it opened up 3 or so years ago, which is a lot considering I live no where close to it, and all I can say is that my bread has always been fresh, I've never had a salad's worth of lettuce on my sandwich, the service has always been friendly and ""freaky fast.""  15 minutes from order time to digestion time.  Additionally, the tables are always wiped down and ready for the next customer, so they've got cleanliness on lock down too.

I had to ask the hostess to find the waitress and send her over.  When she came to the table, she looked clueless, so I asked to speak to the manager.

The manager Heather was nice, took care of the problem and personally brought out the avocado, offered a new sandwich, and to buy a dessert for us.  A nice professional way to take care of the customer...5 stars to Heather...2 stars for the server, and -0- stars for the person making the food...

The play structures were grimy and greasy; my kid's butts were stained from going down the slides. And the flies!!!...there were what seemed like dozens. It was impossible to eat without multiple flies landing on your food or cups. 

It will probably be awhile before I bother going back."

It's one of those super cool Coke machines where you can select from about 20 varieties, each with different flavorings. I mean, where else are you going to get diet vanilla ginger ale? Now all I need to do is find the whisky button...

But I digress. It's a pretty common chain on the west coast, serving up wings and wing-like products in a bunch of different flavors. Boned wings, boneless wings, wing combos--if you read it aloud you sound kinda like Bubba from Forrest Gump. Fifty-cent wings on Mondays and Tuesdays

But the wings are good, the sauces are flavorful (I'm a fan of the buffalo or the bbq). Sometimes they can get a little heavy handed with the sauce so ask for it on the side if that's not what you're looking for. Their fries have a slightly sweet flavor to them (which goes great with some hot wings), and the beans are pretty rocking as well.  Most (all?) have beer and pretty cheap prices during happy hour. 

It's definitely one of my go-tos if I'm in a wing mood or if I'm looking to play with a fancy soda machine."

-The fresh produce and deli are disgusting!  I have yet to meet a person who chooses to shop at Walmart for their groceries
-Customer service is non-existent and I think they have even lowered the bar for other stores

These are all generalizations...yes...I am sure that there is one nice lady working at the deli...but really, if she is so great, you know she would be working at a better store than Walmart.  Unemployment is low, bro, and ShopRite is hiring.

On the plus side, I did get some good ""People of Walmart"" shots...

From my point of view the ribs, brisket, sausage, chicken and the savory sides, are all good to very good, but as with most outlets in the northeast, not nearly as excellent as available in the American South and Southwest. We seem to lack the cultural history that creates the awesome smoked meats and heavily flavorful sauces found in every back road smokehouse from Virginia to Florida and Georgia to Texas. Still, Mission is not a bad substitute when time for a road trip is lacking. 

I enjoyed the Baby Backs I sucked off the bone last weekend. The meat was tender, even if lacking crusty bark, smoke rings and thick, luscious sauces that are the true sign of authenticity. The Texas Twang and Tupelo Honey Heat were too thin to hold fast to the ribs, but remained at the bottom of the tray available for repeated dipping. My side choices of BBQ Beans and Cole Slaw were alright and completed the meal nicely. The corn bread was a small thin square, and somewhat dry, but sweet enough to remind me of what the real thing tasted like. 

So, until I have time to visit my sister in Newport News, my former bro-lo in Charlotte or friends in Austin, Mission will have to do. The folks there are friendly enough to make it a positive experience."

I called to see if my refill was ready... the girl answers and asks if she can put me on hold... then does so before I can say anything... after 15 minutes (FIFTEEN) she gets back on and asks, can I put you on hold! This time I was quicker and said ""well I have always been on hold for 15 minutes"", she tells me she is the only person working except the pharmacist who doesn't take calls. So I said I would just come in. How do you have one person working by themselves at a pharmacy? 

I am this irritated because this is the 3rd time this has happened! 

I get here and there are 6 people in line... I feel bad for the girl because it's BS she is here alone (except the pharmacist) 

The phone rings while I'm in line and THE PHARMACIST ANSWERS... So.... I am left on hold for 15 minutes to ask a quick question but when I get here he is capable of answering?

     I don't particularly enjoy shopping here as I do in other PetSmarts, maybe it's just me but I can't stand seeing employees of any business sitting on the ground, in their uniform, smoking right in front of the establishment.  It's tacky, trashy, low end and disgusting.  
     Second, I always see dead or dying fish in their tanks.  Last night was no exception, it's really very sad to see that as a customer, you'd think the employees would notice that and remove the dead one so the other fish aren't swimming around in there with him.
     My last complaint is about the customer service.  To be clear I am a self sufficient shopper, I don't need you to greet me or offer me assurance - stock your shelves and I will find it myself.  My issue is always at the register.  The lines either go on forever or the cashier is just plain unpleasant. Last night the cashier and one other employee where having a conversation about another employee who did not replace the toilet paper in the restroom.  Meanwhile the cashier kept dropping all of my stuff on the floor.  
     Otherwise, the store is clean, bright and usually pretty well stocked. If they could just move the smokers away from the front door and get their act together at the checkout, they would be five stars."

It makes sense. Most Jimmy John's hire underachievers. The kids who spent more days stoned than actually attending class during high school. The lady who reeks of Newport cigarette smoke and constantly complains about her problems but does little if anything to change her situation. The man child who can talk for hours about philosophy and Minecraft, but can't seem to figure out how to move out of his parents basement. You know, losers.

Seven customers in the line (behind me) left the restaurant before ordering.

It was so bad, we joked that maybe there was some kind of chemical leak in the building.  They were seriously moving in slow motion.

I will never attempt to eat in at this location again.  Drive through only for me.  On second thought, there are so many viable options nearby that I'll probably just skip it altogether."

I was told that the McDonalds had one and since they had one down the street that Redbox wasn't at the Walgreens.  Well, now that Mcds has been rebuilt and they don't have a Redbox....So enough about the Walgreens/Redbox Rant...if your looking for a Redbox this is not your place.

This parking lot is by far the worst one to ever get into and out...just a pointer don't try to come in on the pharmacy side I have almost been run over by parking lot speeders multiple times.  There just isn't much room over there.

This Walgreens is old and usually dirty looking on the inside. They tend to be out of stock on sale items quite often.

The staff is what gave this Walgreens a 3 star for me...they were amazing :)  I don't usually throw the customer service into the mix, just because its hit or miss, but to bump it from 2 to 3 I'll do it this time.

I will go out of my way to go to another Walgreens this one is not convenient and is just below average."

So when I heard that Five Guys was opening in St. Louis, I wanted see what the fuss was all about. 

Here's some basics about the place:
- It's close to the west county mall, so getting there is kind of a pain
- There's usually a line to wait and order your meal, especially on weekends
- The menu is super simple and easy to choose from
- The burgers are made-to-order
- Food is pretty pricey! Especially for a burger joint.
- What I ate was reminiscent  Dairy Queen burger, just more expensive. 
- The fresh cut fries are delish and portions are huge. You would be OK splitting an order with someone else.

Honestly, I am not quite sure what the fuss is about. The food is good, but nothing special. If given the choice, I'd pick Carl's in Brentwood any day over Five Guys. Nothing bad about them, I've just had better.  *That's what she said*

This Yelp review will be about the media darling chicken sandwich and my visit this past Saturday to this location. 

I was finally able to get this sandwich on my third attempt. My second attempt was at another location and they cut off sandwich sales before 9 PM despite the location staying open until 10 PM. I arrived early on a Saturday for lunch and the dinning area had about six folks eating when I arrived. The drive through had about four cars in line. The restaurant was clean and fairly new. The service was pretty quick and polite. 

I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich deconstructed: mayo and pickles on the side. I'm not normally a fan of pickles or mayo, but I've heard these are excellent in combination with the chicken. My order took a bit longer than I expected for fast food during a slow time, but it was less than a 15 minute wait. The first bite of the sandwich was good, a well fried, boneless chicken breast and a sweet bun. I tried the pickles and they were great. The pickles had a nice crunch and not too sour. The mayo had a nice tang and went well with the rest of the parts. I then assembled the sandwich as intended and ate the rest that way. The sandwich was good, but not worth the hype. 

The sandwich may be a blessing or a curse for Popeyes, but they chose to sell it. I'm surprised this location had such low ratings, but this location was pretty good when I came. So yes a good sandwich, but keep in mind it's an just a chicken sandwich from a fast food place."

Background - Needed a quick breakfast and this was the part of town we needed to be in.  Typically McDonald's is my fast food breakfast place, but you do need to see what else is out there once in a while.

Atmosphere - The place is modern, fresh clean feel.  I love the copper lamps.

Food - I had the Extreme Sausage sandwich, aka 27, not the combo.  Of course the picture on the menu board made it look better.  The sausage patties did not even touch the edge of the bread, the picture was misleading.  With that huge difference the sandwich is was still worth getting.  It had a toasted bun which was excellent and the sausage had good flavor.
  
Service - Nothing special but the fact they took my name instead of giving me a number was a nice touch.  We were the only customers in there so they could have skipped it but they still took the time for that.

Future - Sure."

It was quick but expensive if not for locating a coupon. Two people that checked out while I was there had totals of more than $140 after miscellaneous upgrades and cabin filter changes. I had a $19.00 coupon and with the $10.00 ""overcharge"" for my car being AWD it was still over $40 for a 15 minute oil and filter change. (about $20.00 in parts at full retail)

Bottom line, it feels like they will get you if they can. As soon as I sounded like I knew what I was talking about and about what my car required required they stopped the madness. But if I had gone in hoping for a professional and honest crew to only recommend what I actually needed and skip the BS, this is NOT where I would go."

I came here with my family before we hit the slopes for skiing and we ordered 5 Sausage McMuffins. No more than 5 minutes after we ordered, we got our food and was ready to go. The cheese was not fully melted on the sandwiches, and while this sucks, this is consistent with other McDonald's that I've been too. 

Scott's negative review from 12/2/2014 because he was charged for extra dipping sauces is a bit unfair in my opinion. This particular McDonald is not charging customers more than other McDonald's. Other McDonald's will charge you as well for extra sauce."

My review is for the Devon BP gas station, which, yes, has a Dunkin' ""boutique"" inside.

PROS:
- They're open 24-hours. 
- If you practice cocaine-like sugar intake, help yourself to a DnD treat!
- The station is pretty as far as gas stations go. The grounds are tastefully landscaped and well-maintained, and the old stone RR wall in back is neat. 

CONS:
- This station is temperamental about taking your BP rewards (hit or miss at your expense)
- They stopped taking the Kmart coupons from the store 0.2 miles away. It is extremely poor business sense. When gas prices are high, this matters a lot.
- If you have a problem with one of the above, the attendants shrug and do NOTHING to help.

They clearly cater to hedge fund nouveau riche money-wasters, or college kids (the females are probably the dates of the former), who can't be bothered with coupons or rewards programs, and who go there for drunk-late-night snacks.

As for the kid's comments about them ""painting chocolate on donuts"" ...uh, how do you think the fake chemical chocolate gets on your fake chemical donuts? This is not unique to this DnD location, I assure you. Your chemical additive ""food"" is processed in a plant, and painted on at the franchise; they just hide it elsewhere. At least these guys were honest. Sorry you discovered what DnD is really about. Try reading their ingredients."

Upon pulling up to the window we noticed that several employees were not properly wearing masks nor were they wearing gloves. When they opened the window we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over, not properly wearing his mask, and told us the reason for that was because the kitchen is extremely hot. While that is unfortunate, we are in the middle of a pandemic and workers should be taking the extra precautions to be safe themselves and to also keep our food sanitary. Once the manager walked away and the window closed, the young woman working the window started talking badly about us while we can hear her through the window. She then gave us sass when we confronted her about it. Extremely rude and extremely inappropriate. We will be calling the Health Department first thing tomorrow morning."

I asked them to look in the back and had to wait several minutes, hot and holding a squirmy, heavy toddler, when they finally brought up a carton of eggs. Relieved, I paid for it and left. On a hunch, I checked the expiration date on the way home, and they expired three weeks ago. Whoever does the ordering there needs to either improve immediately or be replaced. How hard is it to make sure you order enough inventory? If it was just once or twice, no big deal, but it's happening every time I go in there!

I need to start this off by saying that I love planet fitness and have been going for the past 3 years. I've traveled all around the U.S. and i like to go to the different planets in each state!! Never once have I ever had a problem if my payment hasn't came out, because from my understanding if your balance is under 100.00 you can still workout with the gym. 

Tim Cook (club manager) is by far the rudest manager I've ever delt with. First off to come and get me, after I've called my home store and they tell me all planets have the same rules and policies and urge me to go ahead and start my workout. Really makes me mad. For him to look me in the face and tell me that I'm not going to be able to workout because I have a balance(that comes out on schedule) of 20.00???? Wow. To top it off he talked to two different people on my phone to argue with them lmfao wow what a joke. To add some salt to the wound he says on the phone ""well I'm going to let him workout today?"" Why did I need to be embarrassed if you where going to let me workout? Why did you need me to call my home location 3 times? As I'm being allowed in the gym he looks at me and says ""Don't come back tomorrow if it's not paid!!!! Lmfao Tim is a joke, and I will be back tomorrow just so he can look at my face!!"

Being this has been the only location I've been to, I can say that this one was very clean. The place was empty (which I thought was weird for a Saturday afternoon) and the guy at the counter was more than happy to help me along the way being the n00b that I was. I had ordered a bowl, with a bunch of stuff on it. Brown rice, chicken, fajita mix, hot sauce, guac, etc.... The price seemed a little steep to me, but it looked pretty good. I sat on a stool at the window and chowed down. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible. I really wasn't impressed though.

- two simple prescriptions were on auto fill and on two separate occasions the automated system called to tell me they were ready. After getting to the pharmacy and waiting on line both times, neither was ready. The second occasion they ""lost"" my insurance information and instead of calling me up they let me sit there for about 45 minutes until I finally asked if it was ready yet, and that's when they told me, so I had to wait all over.
- I bought super glue and when I got home and opened the box, there was no glue in it...hopefully just a fluke but rather strange!

Bottom line, be sure to double and triple check everything if you have to go!"

Especially through this bad economy where a dollar is so hard to spend and so hard to get, I needed something cheap and decent. After spending my morning studying, my brother and I decided to go for McDonald's. We ordered two 10 piece chicken nuggets and a Big Mac Meal. This is very unhealthy, and i recommend you all not to do this on the regular. I had my 10 piece nuggets and it was great! Crispy on the outside, soft and juicy in the inside. The service was great. I gave them the money, they gave me the correct change back which was quite impressive. Took less than 2 minutes to get my food and cup. They could work on cleaning the tables a bit more. I found a leftover french fry laying on my table which I flicked off the table. 


but seriously, I'm not a big fan of fast food and probably won't be back til next never."

My usual is a foot long chicken breast sandwich on honey oat bread. I have the bread scooped out and the chicken breast toasted. They used to keep the chicken in a warmer, but that recently changed and they now keep it with the cold meats. I also get lettuce, tomato, spinach and cucumbers with salt & pepper and ranch dressing. It always hits the spot!

Just recently I switched it up and ordered the chicken on honey oat but with spinach, tomatoes, hot peppers, pickles, salt & pepper with chipotle sauce.

They also have soups. My personal favorite is the brown rice with chicken.

Don't forget a point card. For every $1 you spend, you get a point and it adds up pretty quickly. I get a free foot long sandwich at least once a month, just by hitting $75 points."

I saw a promotional sign for $12.95 haircuts. I should have had a haircut 2 weeks ago but had to cancel.  I was desperate and I was starting to see more gray hair than usual. I looked in and saw that nobody was waiting and they had just 1 customer. Knowing that this is back to school haircut time I decided to go in and get my grays removed

I only waited a couple of minutes before I was seating.  I told her how I wanted my haircut and she started snipping away. It wasn't that much longer than I realized she was done.

The wings are not good here and the sauce selection doesn't come in different heats, i.e. you can get mango sauce but not mild mango sauce which means if you don't like it hot then you have to pick another sauce.  They will mix them up for you and some of their sauces are very good and some are very bad.  The preparation is wildly inconsistent as I order well-done wings--which show up however the cook feels like making them so they can be rare or cooked to jerky.  I personally believe that inconsistent preparation is the worst trait a restaurant can have.  McDonald's built their entire franchises and company on the premise that consistency in taste was the most desirable thing they could have and the Big Mac I ate in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Bangkok, Frankfurt and other exotic places I needed a taste of home were EXACTLY THE SAME as the ones anywhere in the USA.  Franchises need consistency and the only consistency BWW has is that it is consistently mediocre."

But for me, this has not been the case with Panera; and I must say that this Panera really does stand out when it comes to their customer service.

I typically order a salad when I go to Panera. Although Panera is a lot priceier than the typical fast food spot you really get what you pay for with their salads; they are pretty big and you always get a free side. I also dropped in every once in a while when I'm having a carb craving and pick up one of their bagels, no cheese cream needed butter and honey does it for me on their good quality carb bombs. One of the things I love about Panera is that they always send out great coupons (if you're a pretty regular customer). And at this location regardless of whether you're using a coupon, just ordering a bagel or customizing everything in your order, they provide consistently pleasant customer service. I've been to other panera's where that is not the case and I've not wanted to return.

I am a stickler on customer service because we are paying for the merchandise and the service that is being provided...otherwise, we are better off getting stuff out of a vending machine...am I right??

They have created the best customer service interaction model in the fast food business, there is no contest!!  So, what can you expect when going to any CFA...the place is always clean, friendly staff, excellent customer service, the food is always spot on; fresh and delicious.  Their waffle fries are neck-to-neck with MickeyDee's fries is my opinion.  When dining in, the staff would routinely stop by your table to ask how was their service, if you need anything (i.e., refill, napkins, etc.), take your tray and clear your trash...what other fast food chain does that?

So, I visited CFA yesterday--like so many on Friday evening--as I pulling up to a parking spot I saw a CFA worker running (full sprint) thru the lot,  to catch up to a car after driving away from the drive-thru window.  I'm sure I won't see that at the other fast food spots!!   

This is evidence that fast food restaurant workers that don't get  $15/hour can still provide quality product and service to their customers. Based on my observation from visiting every CFA, management and/or owners must care for their staff well for them to continue to have that constant high-level performance of customer service."

That being said, I was curious to try their Impossible Whopper. Why? Well, I find that Impossible ""meat"" is fairly tasteless, and I figured that it was the perfect choice for a meatless fast food burger. And I was right! When you eat a Whopper, there's the taste of whatever chemicals/seasonings they put on the meat to give it that ""flame broiled"" taste plus all the veggies. The Impossible Whopper tasted amazingly similar to a normal Whopper, but I could pat myself on the head for having a meat-less meal afterwards. (If anything, this just shows that the Whopper isn't that great of a burger, since it proves that you don't taste beef just everything but the beef.) 

So if you need a fast food meal and want to skip eating meat, the Impossible Whopper is not a bad choice. Of course, if you want a really good vegan meal, try the Mediterranean Chickpea, only a couple miles away."

Well save yourself the ulcer and head on over to Firestone.  I went in for new tires and was prepared for the worst.  Imagine my surprise when an extremely friendly and helpful woman (something about the estrogen made me feel a little more at ease I think) answered the phone and walked me through my options.  Later that day I left the store with a promptly installed set of tires and a credit card that didn't have a hole burned through it.  

More recently I went in to have those tires serviced (nothing was wrong just wanted them checked out before a road trip) and an oil change.  While the man I dealt with was not well-versed in customer service....and spoke so fast I barely got a word in....I left with a cheap oil change and tires serviced for free ( I had purchased a lifetime alignment for around $100 the first time).

There was plenty of deliciously meaty and tender lobster, as well as juicy, succulent shrimp. There were also peas, mushroom, and tomatoes throughout the pasta, which were a nice addition. The sauce was wonderfully creamy, rich, and well seasoned. 

For dessert, there was a special for Pumpkin Spice Lava Cake, consisting of cream cheese molten center, served warm and topped with house-made whipped cream. Since I am a huge fan of all things pumpkin spice, I just had to try it! However, I was a little disappointed. The pumpkin cake had warm hints cinnamon and nutmeg and the whipped cream was so velvety smooth. I just found the cake to be on the dense side and quite dry. Also, I would have liked more pumpkin taste. The cream cheese filling was sweet and thick.

But, they made it happen, and here it is!

The gas prices at Wawa are among the best, and have really helped with lowering gas prices around the area in general because of the competition. Even if other places have slightly lower prices, though, I tend to opt for Wawa because the staff is very friendly, and they have a nice store there where I can go to the restroom, get some cash from an ATM, or pick up some coffee if I want it.

Another great thing that they have at this location is the free air stations - two of them! Quick Chek in Lawrenceville has a similar machine on the premises, which is nice, but there's only one of them there, and it's out of order on a fairly regular basis. Even when it's working, there can be a wait to get air since there's only the one pump. Having two pumps at Wawa is great for that reason. Also, they have dedicated parking spots for the pumps rather than just having it on the side. Great design thinking there.

Altogether, I'm very pleased with this Wawa and think it has definitely improved Ewing!"

I've been here twice and it's always been in the evening and the drive thru is hella crowded. Like don't park near the cars waiting for drive thru or you will get stuck in your space. Park on the other side of the Wendy's parallel to 56th Street (Thank me later). Remember I said it shares a lot with the market.... Anyhoo Kayla really just made my day. After waiting in the drive thru for like 25 minutes (I know I know but I'd don't Feel like cooking), I was a lil irked but when Kayla went to take my order her energy was contagious. She was happy to be there and help the customer. She even upsold me on a few food products. I know she was only doing her job but we all know how fast food employees can be like whatev. Kayla kept her energy up for the customer behind me and even when I got to the window she was working, putting smiles on faces. It's appreciated. Yes my food was HOT AND Scrumptious!!

I came in about 5 months prior, so not sure how long they keep your info in the system.

So she directed me to the Banfield pet hospital (right next to them) and said I could have them clipped there since they don't require proof of rabies vaccine. I know, it's probably their PetSmart policy or whatever but seriously..it was just a pain. The pet salon employee that I talked to was very nice though and I know it's not her fault that they couldn't find me in the system. On another note, Banfield employees were great! Very helpful and understanding, and I didn't have an appointment or anything but they had my dog in and out in about 10 minutes. So grateful because I really didn't feel like leaving and coming back with my proof of rabies and waiting all over again. It cost me $20 for that pedicure (clipped and grinded).

I don't really buy my dog food or pet supplies here because I feel it's a bit overpriced, but when I'm in a pinch, they do have what I need. Employees are friendly and checkout does not take too long."

Second, they screwed up our order. We ordered 3 pizzas and 1 was completely for someone else. So we had to waste time and gas to go back again to get the right pizza. The manager said for the errors they would add a $25 credit to our account because of the problems. We were like great, we can order pizza later in the week as well.

I had the spinach & mushroom etouffee which I really enjoyed. It was quite spicy for me (tame for any normal human being) but I actually enjoyed the spice in this which I usually don't. The portion was huge over rice with a side of toasted bread, loved it! Please note, it comes on a Styrofoam plate not a fancy plate like in their first picture for the restaurant. Really the restaurant is super casual with air conditioning only working on one side well, the door handle has to be spun while being pushed to get in, things could use a little sprucing up. Yats gives you a small town feel in a city with down south cooking.

Big plus for me - they have more than one diet pop option. Most of the time I stick to water with my meals but when indulging in the fizzy good stuff, I partake in the diet variety. They not only had Diet Pepsi but also Diet Mt Dew & Diet Dr. Pepper. Happy mouth.

Bathroom - Eh. Don't go in there if you can avoid! Wasn't too clean and the paper towel thing came apart when I tried to take one out. I put it back together and stuck to hand dryer after that."

ANOTHER 30 minutes pass and I call him screaming. Still nothing can be done because he refuses to give the meal for free or give me a coupon or anything to make this right, stating there is no guarantee for time.

This is one of the busiest Wawas I've been to - I think its proximity to I275 makes it a quick and easy stop for a lot of commuters.  When I pulled in to get gas, most of the pumps were already in use.

I went inside to get an Italian sub sandwich to go. Wawa's has the best ordering system of anybody I know - just type everything you want into their computer system, and then wait for it to be ready.  I killed time waiting for my sub by looking at the wide variety of chips they have available for purchase.  They seem to have many more options than any other gas station or convenience store.  They carry chips with Old Bay Seasoning, and I never can resist getting a small bag.  I also paid for my sandwich in advance, so when it was ready, I could just take it and go.

I did feel like the sandwich took longer here than at other Wawas.  The two people behind the counter were busy chatting with each other, calling out to managers passing by, looking around at the customers, etc.  I also felt that this location was not as clean as the other Wawas I frequent.

Cheapest gas in town, great subs, and plenty of chip options make Wawa and excellent spot to stop."

After tracking down my roomie, I took the train downtown where she gave me the key and a couple bucks to get a coffee, which I was now desparate for.

Over there you can find a Waffle House every third blink of an eye on the beach (aka Hwy 90). That's the only place we go to for breakfast as there aren't many other breakfast options on the Coast.

In New Orleans it is hard to find a Waffle House so I was ecstatic when I first noticed that they were building one next to the driving range I go to in St Rose. You know what makes Waffle House special: Their hashbrowns!! Ask any Waffle House aficionado what is the best thing on the menu and most everyone will say their hashbrowns. You can get them plain, with chili, with sausage gravy, with jalapenos, with mushrooms, with ham, and of course with cheese. Or if you're a daredevil you can order your hashbrowns ALL THE WAY which raises the bar even more because they throw ALL of the aforementioned toppings into it.

Waffle House is like most other diners and breakfast places where you can order breakfast/lunch/or dinner anytime. They also have a dollar menu that has a few $1 items, $2 items, $3 items, and so forth. I would recommend the All-Star Breakfast if you're really hungry as it comes with a waffle, hashbrowns, eggs, toast, and either ham/bacon/or sausage.

The service at Waffle House is usually very quick and they treat you like family. Another reason to love Waffle House: I hear their coffee is pretty darn great. I don't drink coffee or eat waffles so I can't comment on either but lots of people love their coffee and eat the waffles over here.

Waffle House is an American breakfast institution. Try it sometime."

Oh, and this post office doesn't open until 9:30 a.m.  Since when does the post office open that late?  Be warned: if you put your mail on hold, good luck getting it when you return to town.  If you indicate that you want the mail delivered to your home at  the end of the hold, it won't be delivered.  If you're like me, you'll have to go this location no fewer than three times and beg the postal workers to look for your mail before they find it.  And if you think you've learned your lesson and indicate that you want your mail held at the post office, they'll cram two weeks worth of mail into your box instead of holding it for you.  

This post office is the exact reason I now avoid USPS at all costs.  Like others have said, I used to prefer USPS over private companies.  No longer.  I just don't trust them with my mail and it's certainly not worth the aggravation."

The AC  is very loud andsounds like it is on its last leg. Perhaps that is why it is a bit on the warm side. One side of the gym has air flow from 2 huge fans. The other side lacks air movement. I guess it depends on what you go to the gym for but this one lacks in many respects.

I ordered the two entrée bowl with veggie fried rice and Sweet Fire chicken breast for under $7. My meal was hot, even after driving to my next stop. Their bowls are served in a sturdy to go container so you don't have to worry about a mess once you get to your destination. 
The young man working the drive thru was very nice. Thanked me and actually said ""have a good day"", not super common anymore.  Everything I needed was in my bag without asking (soy sauce, fork/spoon and a fortune cookie). 
Sweet Fire chicken is advertised to be hot. In my opinion it wasn't hot. Spicy, yes but not hot. Fried rice was good and not overly salted like most Chinese restaurants. 
I always forget about this place because its semi tucked back off the road but after this experience I'll definitely be returning."

She responded with, ""we can't use our store cards, we don't have any,"" okay so I said, can I sign up for one then since I want the sale price? Her response,"" we don't have any cards on site to sign up. As she starts talking to the other sales person and they both say yea we haven't had cards for weeks!

The menu has a good variety without giving you too many options to choose from. The drink menu is also not super basic but also not overwhelming which is nice. The ambiance is actually much more hip than I originally anticipated. The wait staff was very friendly and the food has been timely and delicious each and every time I have gone.

There are some great employees at this site but I travel further from my home to go to other locations that are clean and actually have smiling happy employees. This location is frequently out of items like half and half, sliced apples, basic items that should be in stock.
The township should not have allowed this store to open \at this location it is an extremely dangerous intersection and the store has far too much volume for the parking lot design.

It is obvious, the management here is focused on customer service and has trained their staff well. 

As others have commented, this store is always clean and well organized. Having just moved into a new house, I am making numerous runs to this Target. I am amazed at the things I didn't need in my old house, I now need in my new house.

Tip 1 - use their check in app ahead of time to get your name on the wait list before you arrive, that will save you time. I noticed after the fact that the Yelp mobile app included this ability so take advantage of it. 

Tip 2 - if you are unfamiliar like I was, check out the menu online beforehand so you have an idea of what you might like to order. 

There are all kinds of options for how you can do breakfast. From what I understand, this is farm to table venue. 

While we awaited our turn to be seated, (notification is by text), I noticed they had help yourself brewed coffee out for folks, what a nice move by the venue, thank you, much appreciated. 
The other move when you get seated is they bring your table it's own coffee pot so no waiting around to get your mug topped off at this place.

Our server was friendly and funny, did not catch her name but I did appreciate her style. 

They got most of the orders correct, there was some confusion on one, they thought it was the sandwich version instead of the breakfast plate version, no worries, they were quick to fix.

What worked for me? The million dollar bacon, the cheese grits, and the market veggie sandwich, although the tacos looked good too.

I did taste the healthy lemonade drink thing they do and it was good. 

A solid breakfast option if you have one in your area, it seemed really popular with folks."

They don't have a lot of the food options and don't typically participate in promos. If you're an avid app user - beware no mobile orders and no redeeming star rewards but at least you can spend the gift cards.

Pros: Best coffee shop hours downtown, would be great if it were open even later but anything after 5 is still a rarity around here. Open on the weekends (live music which may or may not be what you want out of your weekend coffee stop). Lots of outlets.

Unfortunately this Starbucks is kind of dirty. Especially the bathrooms which are locked and must be unlocked by a staff member. Given that the employees are unlocking the door so much you'd think they'd stay on top of the cleanliness... to be somewhat fair they are nice enough to let anyone use the restroom who asks and it seems that some homeless people are using the space to bathe/freshen up. That is a difficult situation but still the dirty paper towels and water all over the floor have to be dealt with.

Some of the employees are super sweet and make visiting a great experience. Some seem like they hate anyone who walks in the door. Hit or miss attitudes, but at least the drinks are made correctly and quickly."

Already written this review. 
Eating Capital Tacos
For me, is nothing new

At last year's Yelper party
I got to try their chicken fajitas. 
I got to be first in line!
I totally beat ya!

Ever since then, I'd say
I'm a Capital Taco fiend. 
Even if you've only been once
You probably know what I mean. 

My hands down favorite taco 
Has got to be the Texas Flood. 
I've eaten so many of those
I've got chipotle BBQ in my blood!

Second place goes to the Austinite
W/ carne asada and chihuahua cheese. 
A winning flavor combination 
That will bring you to your knees!

Everything they offer can be made 
As a taco, burrito, nachos, salad or bowl. 
I think I'll end this poem now
While I'm still on a roll."

During that time the 2-3 staff members were quickly, efficiently helping customers mail their packages. Then John came and brought me back to the finger printing station. He was polite, quick, not hurried and he had a kind, gentle way about him.

Also the service, while my expectations are not high, is extremely slow and often incorrect.

This location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either, so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location, no one at corporate can do anything for you, you are just SOL.

One time, I stood behind an elderly man in line, and seeing the smile on the Dunkin workers' face when he said, ""Hello- how are you?"" in her native language was adorable- her smile could have lit up the whole restaurant. 

The people who work at this location are really personable and clearly care about their customers, and in turn, the customers get to know them. Once, my DD Perks phone app didn't work, and the manager followed me out to my car to apologize and make sure that everything was alright. As with any location, the speed of service depends on how long the line is (especially the drive-thru line), but it is obvious that they really make an effort to be as efficient as possible. 

Bottom line- this is a really nice (and always clean) Dunkin location that has the feel of a smaller establishment rather than a big chain, and I like that."

I give Starbucks points for having locations pretty much everywhere on the Planet, and this one turned out to be convenient in a pinch, but the coffee here (and at all the other links in the chain) is just AOK at best, and considering the prices, the value proposition is questionable at best.

I had my vehicle towed back to the service center which was my 2nd mistake and received a call that repairs would cost $1,000.00. Their explanation for the violent rocking of my vehicle was ""we where checking the suspension"", which is an out right lie, especially since I was not having any suspension issues.

Our order took close to 15 minutes to complete, and we had to go back for an item that they forgot.  It looks like they're trying to cut costs by running it with as few employees as possible. If they keep this up their costs will be zero since it will be out of business.

Wow....if the people who work in this place were any slower they would be moving backward. I've seen several occasions where people in the drive-thru lane just give up and leave, even after placing an order.  I spent 15 minutes there this morning, with ONE CAR in front of me, waiting for a simple breakfast order.

       If you are on the road and want a filling meal at a reasonable price, this is where you want to stop."

When I originally researched the place I expected a more upscale experience, given the location, menu, etc.

When we arrived I was impressed with the décor, lighting, fantastic vaulted ceilings with some incredible wood beams, it was the tits.  I then looked at the menu a bit more, and was taken back by the reasonable prices for the cuts of meat.  What put me off more than anything was the mix of clientele, ranging from gentlemen in full suits, to kids in flip flops and tanks.  Given the location, at the mall essentially, I guess this should have been expected.

Then the food came.  I ordered the pepper crusted strip, which in the simplest of terms was fantastic. I love black pepper crusted anything, and this was great stuff. The odd thing was the fact that in an effort to be more upscale (a la carte meat), the steak came by itself  on a massive plate, which made the steak seem tiny.  With it I ordered the Caesar salad, my usual accompaniment.  The two together, tethered with two Manhattans made the night complete.

On top of that, the bill, with included my wife's entrée along with a glass of wine was still less than $100.  Compare that to my time at Sullivan's, which resulted in a $200 bill, and I now know where I'll go from now on to get a quality pepper crusted steak.

This review tries to cover everything. 

THE GOOD:
Popeyes makes awesome chicken. Moist,  flavorful, crispy. 

Service: brand new store,  happy,  young,  eager employees on the front line. 

THE BAD:
The price: expensive and the portions are miniscule. I got a family meal for 6. The two ""large sides"" were much smaller than expected,  and our mac n cheese wasn't even full! 
The 1st time I came,  I grabbed their ""1/4 lb!"" Popcorn shrimp deal. There was only a handful of shrimp. 

Service: the workers were cheerful and awesome,  but management was not friendly and seemed irritated with my happy worker guy who asked (for me) if they had paper menus you take with us. Also: They still aren't taking American Express. I realize this is a technical issue, not their fault,  but when my happy worker guy asked when they would be accepting it,  the manager brushed me off, blamed amex and didn't apologize. 

The gravy is gross. And they put it on top of the potatoes... not on the side. 

Mac n cheese is noodles covered in processed cheese. Nothing special.

TAKEAWAY:
Don't come here without a coupon. 
Managers need to match their employees enthusiasm.
Eat the chicken, skip the traditional sides."

Memories of this location were great, a go-to location for after late night events like Carmel football games.

However, I went a couple weeks ago and the entire experience was awful. The restaurant seemed like there were only three employees working. The manager running the to-go orders, one cook, and one indoor dining server, who was serving about 8 or 9 tables by herself.

I dined in, and the place was a complete mess. We're talking about 5+ tables with their dirty food plates not cleaned up.

The burgers, fries, and shakes were decent - only reason I'm giving two stars. The chili looked awful. My dad tried to send it back because it tasted bad and he wanted baked beans instead, and the server wasn't sure if she could do that, had to get a manager for it instead of just taking the chili and getting him some baked beans.

The food deals they have are good, but if they can't staff properly, this place is never going to get better.

We called several time, and were told they were waiting on parts.

The problem there is that there isn't parts, the system is quite simple. If it was complicated they could just replace the whole rotisserie system as it would probably be cheaper than ordering parts and paying people to repair it. We spoke to several people including the manager and they all told us that this would be dealt with.

I spread it evenly on my sliced cornbread, but it didn't make much of a difference. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way and it was chewy. I had to drink a lot of water with it. 

I also got the Fresh Daily Catch of the Day Fish and Chips with Old Bay seasoning, which was very good. My favorite were the fries, seasoned perfectly. The fish was soft, but the batter could have been cooked a little more for crispness.

I will come back to try other dishes. 

Happy eating!"

Last time, I was just driving through Nashville. This time, I'm actually here working for a couple of weeks and my hotel is around the corner.

Night and day, comparing this Waffle House to the one on Elm Hill. A much friendlier and happier staff. Cleaner tables. And the food was cooked better.

I usually have the same thing at a Waffle House - the All Star Breakfast. Eggs over easy, wheat toast dry, hash browns with cheese (covered) and with ham. It was all perfect today. Exactly as it's supposed to be at a Waffle House.

Yay! I'm a fan!"

Don't bother going to Trader Joe's on Friday after work, I mean like anytime after work ! So if work ends at 3pm don't bother! Don't bother! Don't bother! It is so nerve racking it will take all Saturday to recover - it's insane! I found my patience running low and a negative feeling about all people in general welling in my gut. I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE RANTS  ABOUT THIS LOCATION. I'd like to blame the students because they overpopulate all of Center City for eight months out of the year and when they're gone the place is tolerably crowded - but well like poltergeists they're back and they are everywhere!  But it's not their fault TJs refuses to open another location in center city or university city or south street like WHOLE FOODS did! 

Did you hear that Trader Joe's? Whole Foods opened another location and I hear they're opening a THIRD one in UC - or at least I'm starting a rumor that they are ! So hey Trader Joe's open another location! I can't take it anymore! I want to shop in your store but if you're gonna continue to underserve my community I'm going to quit you babe!"

As we entered the building, it was pack like a sardine can. All tables for filled and the line was long. The kids were hungry so I went to grab a table if it came free while the hubby ordered. To our surprise a table became free and the line moved exceptionally fast.

The kids got the kids' meal chicken nuggets with fruit cups and lemonade. The hubby ordered the original sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. I ordered the Market Salad which had grilled chicken, blue cheese, apples, berries, nuts, cucumbers, and lettuce served with apple cider vinaigrette. 

All the food came out fast and correctly. I was delighted my the Market Salad as I hate fruit in my salad but it was absolutely delicious. I will be back just for that salad alone."

I came with three other people on a Friday night. We used ""call ahead seating"" (aka keep a fool occupied). We called at 6:30pm and were told to arrive at 7pm and we would be seated in a few minutes. At 7pm handed a pager and told ""15 minutes"". At 7:30 still not seated with an empty table nearby.
The noise level is ridiculous. No normal person is going to be able to hold a conversation without
A. Screaming to be heard
B. Requiring a hearing exam and hearing aids after leaving.
I left. The people I came with stayed because they were freakin' hungry. You could offer me free lobster on my next visit and I wouldn't return.

I was diagnosed with Celiac disease around 15 years ago and in that time I've lived in half a dozen states and I've tried gluten-free pizza in all of them.  They're almost always the same thing, bland tasteless sauce, undercooked cardboard for crust and the kind of crappy cheese you'd expect on a lunchable.  On top of that, most places, even the ones that guarantee they're strict about cross contamination, end up glutening me to some degree.  
Up until I tried this Papa John's gluten-free, the best pizza I had was in LA made by some celebrity chef with celiac who prides himself on running an entirely gluten free restaurant.  If somebody told me that I'd get a better pizza at a chain in Berwyn, I'd never believe it.. until I tried Papa Johns.  

The sauce is sweet with a velvety mouth-feel, the cheese was as close to perfection as any could hope for in this world and the crust was baked better than any gluten-free bread I've had. 
 For the first time in fifteen years, I finally felt like I was eating actual pizza again.  
I salute you Papa John.
I really appreciate the staff and managers, who not only used better ingredients to make a better pizza, but who knew everything about cross-contamination and celiac-friendly practices to create a perfect pizza that left me feeling bountiful joy instead of bloat and illness.

If you have celiac or even just a gluten-sensitivity, do yourself a favor, order from the Berwyn Papa John's today."

I've been here a few times now. My first experience was to celebrate the engagement of two of my lovely friends. After that, it was for celebratory lunch outings. Parc served as the perfect restaurant for all of these occasions. The restaurant is gorgeous. I love the beautiful and decorative set up, high ceilings and the spacious seating arrangements. 

My favorite dish is the warm shrimp salad. It is so simple but tasty and just the right portion size. It can be the main course but will leave you with room for hors d'oeuvres or sides. I recently had the French onion soup before my salad and it was excellent. Hands down, the best French onion soup I have ever had. I devoured every last spoonful. The presentation for both of these dishes was flawless. 

Given the overall feel of this restaurant and the fact that the prices are a bit steep, this makes for a wonderful restaurant to visit for a special occasion.

It used to be you could use their computer for as long as possible to print. I never saw an issue with that because every time I was printing, I've never seen another person need the computer. I'm guessing it is a corporate change because now you slide your card at the computer and then it starts to time how long you take. You're paying for the time! This wouldn't bother me if the computer didn't go so slowly. It took me over three minutes to log into my email and print. That would take me 20 seconds at home. 

The one benefit is you don't have to interact with anyone. It was all done at the computer and when I was done it printed a receipt for me.

The avocado toast was smashed high with green goodness and I was excited to take a bite, until I came back with a mouthful of olive oil. Someone did not understand the definition of light drizzle and my avocado toasts were unedible because of it.

- GREAT LOCATION: I love that this Wawa is mainly one you walk to - when I was growing up Wawas were only in the 'burbs and its surreal to see them on blocks in the city

CONs:
- SELECTION: stock looked low for most of their prepared foods - which I think is the main draw of Wawa these days
- SERVICE: the line was seven people long when I went to check out and there didn't seem to be any urgency by the staff to get another cashier

They are on nearly every street in St. Louis (no shortage in Chicago either ) and I can only assume it's like this in many other cities across the country.  They are ugly, they are ruining the environment, they are taking up valuable land, and they are expensive.

This particular Walgreens has the WORST pharmacy ever.  I'm not even entirely sure there are any real pharmacists back there.  I have waited 4 days for a prescription that I was told would be ready in 1 hour!   This is absurd.  Frequently they didn't fill the prescription yet when you come in at the time it is supposed to be ready.  On occasion I have even had them ""lose"" my prescription.  How on earth is this possible?  They don't call when it is FINALLY ready either.  You have to keep calling them.  I hate when you have to do the job and don't get paid for it.

Thank God none of my prescriptions have been a matter of life or death or I would not be here right now to write this scathing review.  I can see why God kept me here---to spread the word about Walgreens!  My life does have a purpose!  

I will say the Indian woman running the photo department is the NICEST employee any Walgreens could ever ask for.  She always talks to me and every time I see her she says I look exactly like her niece.  It's neat to know I have a twin out there somewhere!  If only she could fill my prescriptions as well.  I trust her far more."

So after going to the Casino, Mom and I headed home by an unusual route. She wanted an Iced tea, so we went through the drive thru. We placed our order and drove up.  There was no greeting, no total given, just a hand thrust out the window. I put my money in said hand, and a few minutes later my change was literally thrown into my palm. No ""Thank you, have a nice day"" no ""Here's your change, pull forward to the next window."" And most importantly, NO RECEIPT.

At the next window, as I waited for my order, a part of it was handed out. The expiditer turned away, when he turned back he looked surprised to see us still there.. ""Um, the rest of my order, please?"" Oh.. yeah.. and he handed it out to me as well. 

Again, no pleasantries, nothing to say ""Come back again."" nothing. Clearly this store needs re-training. Needs to know that even a smile at the window makes a difference.

Their folks in the cheese department and occasionally the beer department are always very nice and helpful. Last time I was in here we were picking up beers for bayou kayaking and were turned on to El Gose from Avery Brewing (up in Colorado) that's a German-style Sour Ale with Lime and Sea Salt Added. If you know me I usually go cheap Mexican beer and tow along cut limes and a bag of salt (yes, I'm that person), so this beer was an excellent choice for floating the bayou!

The thing about these gyms is that you really have to discipline yourself and know what workouts are good for you. For $10 a month you get many machines for cardio, weights, and stretching. They do not have classes or somebody guiding you like a personal trainer. It is really all up to you. For a little more you get tanning beds and some massage chairs, but I see no use in those. The staff at this location is kind of forgettable at times. The awkwardness of women cleaning the men's locker room, or some select staff that are obviously out of shape but shouldn't they be setting an example for you to get fit? Yea there is that ""Lunk Alarm"" that occasionally goes off from people dropping weights too loud, but it is honestly no big deal.

I visit my dear 88- year old mother at least once a week.  My mother has minimal demands and will enjoy dining at the least pretentious locations.  When cold or allergies are not plaguing her, we patronize local fare in her neighborhood.  I generally don't patronize ""fast-food"" establishments. I only visit them with mom.  One of her favorites is Chick-fil-a.

We often visit this Chick-fil-A. The facility is clean and organized.  The counter staff is attentive and courteous.  The food is good and the prices reasonable.  Notable is the employees offering to remove cups, cartons, and misc food paraphernalia when the diner is clearly finished eating.  This effort is appreciated.  Do other fast-food chains offer this amenity? 

Try the grilled and sliced chicken breast, nestled in a fresh mix of Green Leaf lettuce with shredded red cabbage and carrots and a blend of shredded Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses, tightly rolled in a flaxseed flour flat bread. 

When I see mom next week....think I'll try their soups."

This is a well stocked store, and carries anything you can imagine needing from a drug store.  They run lots of specials - as all Walgreens stores do, and if you use your rewards card, you'll find that the rewards really do add up.

The staff is super friendly, and I'm always greeted warmly when I walk in.  There is always someone to help out if you're looking for something specific, and they never make you feel like you're a bother.

My favorite thing about the store is the Beauty Enthusiast program.  I joined a few months ago, and LOVE it!  I'm one of those people who loves a freebie.  I love samples like nobody's business, and as a Beauty Enthusiast, you get samples when checking out in the cosmetics department.

I get ALL of the toppings (cheese, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, onions, pickles, peppers, olives and jalapeños!). I like my sandwiches STACKED, that's how you pack in all the flavors. My oldest child eats like a grown man so he gets an adult sized sub. My two younger children eat like birds so they can share a six inch. They do offer a kids meal but the sandwich is a bit small in my opinion. Mom tip - get the six inch regular sub and if your child doesn't eat the entire sub in one sitting save it for their next win. Mom win! Cool thing about subway is they have many bread options to choose from, including a wrap. They are known for their toppings and sauces. And to polish off your sub you can choose either chips or cookies and a drink. I like them for lunchtime but if you need a quick dinner idea Subway would be a good choice."

I felt shame. I felt guilt. I felt embarrassed. 

And then sure enough just as quickly as he left he was back with my second drink. Instead of being annoyed and bitter that I made him run in the heat TWICE, he was simply confused.

Burger King's shop is nice. It's clean, neat, well laid out and comfortable. I ordered a burger and fries, and water. The burger was excellent. It is a totally different animal from a Big Mac and is, in my opinion, a better burger by far.

The fries appeared to be cut a little thicker than those in Maccas, and this suits me. So to the staff. As with McDonalds, it seems the old days when the staff comprised happy little kids earning pocket money, have disappeared into the ether. Mostly the Burger King's staff is older women, but the service was excellent.

My only criticism was of the water. They have a combination drink machine which dispenses all things fluid and drinkable. I guess the lines are dirty, because no matter how often I tried to fill my cup, the water was tinted (probably with Coke syrup) and not clear. This tells me the lines are not cleaned sufficiently often, and I recommend avoiding the drink machine as a result.

If the water had been nice, I would have offered four stars and, despite my genuine enjoyment of Maccas (when they get it right), I think my once weekly sortie into fast food will be to Burger King in future."

I ordered crispy chicken  quesadilla. My wife tried the burrito supreme chicken.

The crispy chicken quesadilla in my lunch bag was far from what I'd expected, The promised crispy-fried triangles looked like triangles of soggy, folded over,, pita bread. In the middle of each triangle was an amorphous, tasteless substance. Not a bit of chicken could be found. If this had ever been heated, it was long, long ago. Clearly, this dish never should have been served. After eating her burrito supreme chicken,may wife shad that she never would eat in a Taco Bell again.

Now to rate this Taco Bell. The lady who worked the menu was super helpful. My meal, the crispy chicken quesadilla, belonged in the Fast Food Hall of Shame. Two stars for this Taco Bell."

We had last visited them several years ago when they first opened in Westfield Countryside Mall.  At that time, we didn't have the best experience.  Wow, what a change! We were quickly greeted and seated.  If you've never been, it's a beautiful restaurant with lots of TVs and open space.  Their menu is massive.  Luckily, our waiter (Ben) made some wonderful suggestions for our meal.

For entrées, we ordered the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken and the Enlightened Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles.  We both opted for a side Caesar Salad, too.  The Parmesan-Crusted Chicken was lemony and delicious!  It was perfectly cooked. (see pic)  It came with steamed broccoli and sat on a big scoop of mashed potatoes.  It was a huge portion.  The noodle dish was delicious, too!  It wasn't too spicy and had lots of tender chicken.  We would order both dishes again.  The Caesar Salads were very tasty.  The salads were not a huge portion but they were ample and fresh.

As a heads-up, BJ's has a higher price point for it's fare than say Chili's, Applebees or Cheddars.  However, the ambience, portion size and service was stellar.  The service was speedy and friendly.  Be sure to sign up for their rewards program.  We can't wait to go back!"

""I will have the locos doritos tacos!"" I exclaimed. After my brief wait I received my order on a tray made of what I can only assume was solid gold. I sat in my private booth built for a king in anticipation of the delicacy that I was to take part in. How do I describe the first bite in words? It was as if all the chefs of the world conglomerated on this one item and no flavorful stone was left unturned. I had died and gone to fast food heaven. I immediately thanked the 5 star ghetto chef behind the laminated counter and face full of acne that delivered this  other wordly cuisine wrapped in cellophane to my taste buds.

But I couldn't drive back. So forced myself to enjoy this weird sandwich I didn't even want. 

The sandwich wasn't good either- next time I go to McDonald's I'm getting a burger- chicken sandwiches taste strange there- ended up eating a few bites then giving it to my dog. The kids however enjoyed the chicken nugget kids meals and the toys and apple slices that came with it!

And they have so many interesting options... great selection of snacks, sauces, cereals, meals, fish, pre-prepared food... way better than the local Acme or Genuardi's.  I especially love the sundried tomato chicken sausage and aioli garlic mustard spread.  I'm not into the whole organic thing, I just like healthy, good food.

The staff is always friendly too; I walk out of there feeling pretty happy and content with my purchases, instead of the usual stressful ""I have to get out of here"" feeling when I leave a grocery store.  Plus they use nice big paper bags instead of crummy plastic bags.

They have faxed insurance authorizations for medication to the wrong physicians creating an extensive waiting time. I have never had a smooth month with this pharmacy. There is zero initiative on their part.  Here's the thing- I don't want to yell. I just want the medication that is needed every 30 days to be there, I think that's a simple request. If something needs an auth I don't mind waiting the standard 24-48 hours but don't blame the doctor when clearly it has been your error since day one.

The women working here were on point and gave me maybe the best late-night fast food customer service I had ever received.

They obtained some contaminated beef and they did not bother to throughly cooked.  Also this location sucks with too many truck stop adjacent to this place and it is a pain to get in and out of.

Well it has been over 20 years since they had killed anyone with their food so I thought that I would brave the place again.  Well the fries were greasy and stale and the container was only a fraction of being fulll.  The seven dollar burgers are way over priced for what you get and the burger did not taste like it should for $7.00.  

I am not going back to Jack in the Box again at this loaction, McD's, Burger King, Taco B, Arbys and more are in same area and food is much better, but I rarely go to any because they are fast food.  I used to love their sour doe grilled burgers, but I have no interest in going back if they do not change a lot!

Sure I used to eat fast food constantly in college and long after too, but I am working on eating healthy."

I go with my friend to dinner on Tuesday, around 6:30/7. Not very busy and we are seated right away.

Here's where I get confused.  My friend ordered the Cobb Salad with chicken and I order the Cobb salad with the ""blackened Ahi Tuna"".  Here is the conversation that follows:

Me:  ""Can you please cook the tuna all the way through?""

Waiter: ""oh we can't do that, I've already asked in the past and the chef won't do it""

Me: ""you can't just keep the tuna on the grill for a couple extra minutes?

Waiter: ""no because we have a specific recipe we follow and we can't change the recipe to order""

Me: ""but...I don't understand...nothing is changing...""

Waiter: ""yeah sorry. The chef Sears the tuna for only a couple seconds on each side. He won't keep it on longer.""

Ok then.  Fast forward to the meal... I ended up getting the salmon, which was actually pretty good, but was the only enjoyable part of the salad.  The avocado slices it came with were barely enough to make a tablespoon and the Avocado vinegarette  was very...bitter?   There just wasn't enough to the salad.  No flavor, no pizzazz.  But I guess it was typical TGIF fare.  I wouldn't go back.

I just don't understand why the waiter wouldn't even ask the chef to cook the fish longer.  I've gotten tuna ""cooked through"" at every other restaurant I've ever ordered it at, as long as I've asked...to state that the recipe couldn't be ""changed"" just doesn't make sense."

As this is a new store I'm hoping what I experienced is not going to be the norm, I will deff give them another go. (After you see my reason for a 1 star let me know if you agree) 
  My frustration before anything is with the design of the store, you have a parking lot on each side and when you come in from the door closest to the register the fun begins.  Everyone who is in line, waiting for an order, grabbing a drink, and coming in from that closest door is all in the SAME space.  Nobody knows who has ordered, who's next, it's just a nightmare.
  Maybe Tony from the Fairview location spoils us but I'm used to strips cooked to order, this place has a  McDonald's type model where they get made and sit in a tray.  The results?  Lukewarm soggy chicken strips, the rest of my meal was lukewarm as well from the buscuit to the potatoes with a dab of gravy.  
  Food quality yet dissapointing can be fixed, what scares me working in management myself is when managers neglect the small details.  I experience 2 rude managers and a owner or GM who tucked his hands in his pants in front of the counter and proceeded to make orders.  YUCK, wash your hands!  I pictured a manager not wearing a name tag, a booth being taken up by a managers computer during lunch rush, (don't leave it there let someone eat in that spot!

  The hype on this place is unreal it is in no way worthy 5 stars, people giving thus place 4-5 stars must have a horrible palate.  My visit was quick, first impression the place was very clean which I LOVE! I found the menu a little underwhelming as it didn't see to have many choices, chickin sandwiches modified with different toppings. I opted for the strips which is my go to at any place that serves chicken.
  Food- Sadly it came out lukewarm/cold, you could tell they have been sitting. They lost big points from me having to remake them, they also did not burst with flavor and texturally were soft and not crunchy. Popeye's makes strips to order so they are always hot, the spices ensure flavor, and they have great texture. I did like Chic's bbq sauce dipping sauce better as it had some great zing.  
  My last gripe about this place is that the drink machines are at the register, the cashier continually has to stop and fill drinks.  If you are getting a refill you feel awkward going to the front of the line where people are ordering.  Being a Christian I did enjoy the music is instrumental worship music, this was quite refreshing as I ate and give them props for this.

One of the absolutely worst that I've ever seen. It is (in my Donald Trump voice) AWFUUUUUUUL!!!! If you park next to the building, you are so screwed. Get ready to be blocked in for several minutes at a time while calling your boss to tell them that you are running late. The drive-thru has a very unique shape to it, in that it takes up nearly three quarters of the building upon entering from the main road. In addition, the drive-thru backs up so badly that you are better off walking in and making your order. It seems as if there are three baristas waiting to assist you within the drive-thru alone. 

The drive-thru obviously isn't the fault of the Starbucks employees, but it kind of sucks from a customer point of view. Its probably best to do what I did while on my second visit: park 15-20 parking rows away from the building so that you can walk inside of the store to purchase your yum yums.

Two things to note for this specific location:

1. The parking situation is atrocious. Very limited parking. After the 7 or 8 spots are taken, you have to basically find grass or any concrete to squeeze your car into OR you can venture to Walmart, park there and walk back to Starbucks. Honestly, you are better off going to another Starbucks nearby. 

2. The service can be unusually slow with some inaccuracies in the drink recipes. I have ordered mobile before from the I275 Highway and my drink was still not ready. I recently ordered the Pink drink and there was no coconut milk in the drink when I received it. I didn't bother to tell them.

Maybe I have a brake light out that I want to replace myself.  Or maybe I need a new license plate frame.  It could be I need to replace my floor mats.  For all these things they're great.  Ditto for the staff.

Also, the chicken sandwich had about 5 small pieces of chicken on each half and no sauce.

He said the only compact they had available was a chevy spark which it seems to me the little pokeball (tiny vehicle) could be no more than an economy vehicle, which is a 4 door smart car in all reality. Anyways, once the representative showed me the vehicle I disagreed as to why would I even consider taking that vehicle since there was no way that could be considered a compact, however, he stated it was and that it was his only vehicle, a lady who was returning her vehicle stated she had a toyota corolla and that she was done with it and could take it, the rep went ahead and said that vehicle was not available. I proceeded to say thank you and that I was not going to take that vehicle because it was not what I had reserved, so I left, and he seemed unimpressed and unwilling to accommodate a customer.

- they handle food allergies very well and supply alternative menus that allow customers to see what food is available given your allergy

-The customer service during our particular visit was extremely lackluster and slow. I kept having to ask for a to go box and the check multiple times even after being there for two hours.

-The ma po tofu was more delicious than expected and comes with a generous serving of broccoli.

-The menu features a notation for dishes that I have lower calories making it a little easier to navigate what is healthier versus not

Overall, I think my experience would've been much better had we had better customer service especially given that it was 5 PM and there was almost no one in the restaurant."

As you can guess I am eating out every single day. Here are some quick notes. This Taco Bell has been on point for a whole month, and taking care of me!

1. Service was top notch. Every single night they were pleasant! A breathe of fresh air based on other experiences in the area. 
2. My orders were correct EVERY single time. I am picky and ask for a lot of specific requests (that normally get mixed up here and there). 
3. Love they don't take my card. I place it in the credit card machine myself. 
4. Plenty of napkins (important when eating lunch in a car, or taking it back to the hotel). 
5. Love that they get the hot sauce situation completed during your order. And got the right sauce every single time 
6. Amazingly it looks like they are having a fun time at work during a really crappy time in the world today. Always smiling and joking with each other without it effecting their work/service level. 

Thank you for taking care of me for the past month. I appreciate EVERYTHING y'all are doing at this location. It made my day to day much easier, and I enjoyed my interaction.

They analyzed the car and called us to explain. They were able to identify a couple of issues and gave us options, considering she was an older car. We approved the repairs and they were able to fix her in 24 hours (on a Saturday). They had her back on her feet and running like a new car. 

Pick up was not contactless. We had to go into the office but the clerks were wearing masks and check out was quick. 

We'd go baKe to Firestone and recommend for service."

This restaurant is classic American fare. I had a pecan crusted grilled.chicken salad that was absolutely delicious! I admit I was surprised! It came with the lightest and most tasty buttery croissant I've ever had! The best of my fam had chicken tenders (delicious breading) and ribs. They were pleased! They serve endless chips and salsa of note. The server was friendly and just great. We will definitely be back when we come to the west side to visit fam!!"

Quality: Tasty basics and some unique favorites. Food is cooked properly; not under or over cooked steaks, chicken and sides. Ingredients are basic, no fancy stuff here like aged beef.

Drinks: basic bottles and drafts, creative mixes.

Location: Residential shopping area, plenty parking, easy access. Shopping center security. Be patient the area is diverse; from young mofo's to complete families to turtles.

Service: Friendly rookie kids tend to forget some things. (why does wait staff think it's impressive to memorize, just write it like they do on tv and get it right the first time....sheeeesh) They take their sweet old time... Meh, I've seen worse.

Value: spot on for food, drinks are too high for the atmosphere and location.

Atmosphere: Feels local with Overbrook High and St. Joes stuff on the walls. Friendly service makes all the mistakes very easy to deal with. Happy birthday songs for the birthday person!

Recommend: Boneless wings, Mozz Sticks, Nachos, Steaks, Pasta Dishes.

Avoid: Artichoke/Spinach Dip, Rices.

Conclusion: It's ok, I will return."

The place is still crowded, and the wait for a table just as long on a weekday evening.  The menu looked to be about the same, with the exception of a Specials Menu that had been in place long enough to justify its own handout upon seating.  The prices appeared to be about the same as my last visit.

While I am not usually enamored of the chain ethnic shops, I admit that this most recent experience was of a higher quality than the last.  I didn't remember what I ordered last time, but it turned out I ordered it again.  I did not care for it according to my last review, but this time, the Garlic Rosemary Chicken on the ""Lite"" menu was actually pretty good.  The two breasts had been well-grilled, and the garlic clove sauce was not at all salty.  The mashed were very good.  

My companions were in their first exposure to Olive Garden, and were also quite happy with their Stuffed Chicken Marsala.  

Finally, the three-way split of the Apple Crustada dessert was also a good ending to a surprisingly decent Italian-esque meal. It was a very good version of apple pie a la modec complete with a drizzle of Caramel Sauce.  Given the improvement in quality, we would certainly welcome another gift card.  

Keep up the good work!"

My boyfriend and I decided to try Wing Stop today on a friend's recommendation. We ordered and waited 20 minutes for takeout. We got home and discovered half of our order was missing. Boyfriend called and spoke to the manager before we drove back for the rest of the food. When we got there, the manager came over to speak to us. I began explaining the situation and he abruptly interrupted me and, looking at my boyfriend, said ""you're the one who called? What's missing?"" Um. He may have called but I paid so you can speak to me. So, customer service gets a big, fat F. 

The food was better than the service but not by much. Flavors were decent (we asked the server to describe one flavor and she said ""the Louisiana Rub has a kinda flavor."" Direct quote. Thanks. So helpful). The classic wings were small despite their claims to have bigger wings than the competition. The boneless wings are hard, crusty fried nuggets. The ranch was great but that and the price is definitely not worth the terrible service. I'll stick with Buffalo Wild Wings."

I wasn't even aware of this location. I was glad to know that all of the menu favorites were available here as well. I was really in the mood for the stuffed french toast. My wife and I went on a Friday morning around 10ish. It wasn't crowded at all. We were seated within five minutes. As I mentioned, if you've been to any of the other locations, the menu options here are identical. 

My wife and I shared the egg white turkey bacon frittatta, which includes spinach, tomatoes, turkey bacon and provolone cheese and a stuffed french toast. The stuffed challah french toast is stuffed with farmer's cream cheese and topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup. Next time, I'll probably ask to substitute the bananas with blueberries and strawberries if possible. 

I've never had lunch or dinner menu items at Sabrina's as I've always looked at it as a brunch spot. It's great to know the quality of the food is exactly the same."

On one occasion, I was redeeming a free coffee reward on the Wawa app, and by the time I got to the cashier--an older gentleman--the offer had expired (Why does their app make the offer disappear? I hate that!), so I intended to pay full price which was only $2. But he said he could take care of it, and I was able to still receive it for free. The next time, I pre-ordered on the app and was waiting for my coffee and the kind lady making the iced drinks was so apologetic for my wait, even though I really didn't mind.

So why not 5 stars? Well, not everyone is the friendliest here. Another cashier I had recently, a female, seemed annoyed that I was taking too long to redeem the reward on the app. Well, I had learned the first time, that the app only gives you a certain amount of time to redeem, so I didn't want to risk losing it like last time, so I did it right in front of her, which seemed to be wasting her time.

And this is not so much about this location, but Wawa's app is weird with rewards. I don't get any notification when I have rewards, and when you click to redeem, it starts a countdown. You have to have the cashier scan it in time or it disappears. It doesn't even show up as Expired, Missed, etc. I have never seen a reward system work like that. I really hope they change that feature."

Sadly, I was pretty disappointed; I expected there to be some US brands that many of the US Targets carry, a large selection of products and great prices.  None of which I found.

In my opinion, this Target is pretty much a glorified Zellers or Wal-Mart and that's just because they have a Starbucks inside the store as well as a cart escalator.

Not only that, but when we bit into a slice, the crust was completely ""doughy"" and almost raw. Our boneless hot wings came bone dry with no hot sauce- they looked like little lumps of crap. Look, everyone has a bad day, so, I call them to complain- maybe they will rectify the situation somehow. The idiots working there proceeded to ARGUE with me, telling me I was wrong, and even had the nerve to hang up on me! I was not being rude to them AT ALL, just matter of fact in how disappointed I was. The only thing they said I could do was bring it all back. Well, I was 9 months pregnant, and everyone was absolutely starving! 
Finally, I got it all together, because at that point, no one would even eat the food- it was THAT GROSS, and took it back. I demanded my money back, and they gave me a refund.

I was disappointed this morning when I ordered my venti iced half-caff Americano and a slice of their fabulous low-fat cinnamon streusel coffee cake only to be told they no longer carry it as they've changed their bakery items. The guy on the mic told me the classic coffee cake was very similar and really good. Asked if I wanted to try it so I said sure. Turns out he really did mean TRY it, because it was free!

I used the CVS pharmacy for my rx. What is confusing is if you have to check in with a pharmacist or not - so I ended up waiting in line to double check, come to find out yes you do need to check in and let them know you are waiting. The gentleman who helped was very nice.

Once done with that business I decided to take a look around. I was shocked by all the inventory CVS has on their shelves. It's really a everything market - dairy to booze! The beer/wine prices - I was impressed. Not very high for items on special. Hard liquor - pretty good selection. Wine - I was really impressed by the different labels available.

This is what I saw as I was loading Kennedy (my dog) into my car during the excitement of the pick up.  I brought her back in to inquire why she had a huge sore on her belly. They acted surprised like they had no idea it was there.  They said they had no idea it was there or what may have caused it. They then theorized that it was from the cots that they had to take away on day 2 of their stay because they kept flipping them.  That means the remaining 16 days in their care she had a swollen infected wound in her chest that they did not notice.  The next theory was it was the change in food as they were eating their food.  I explained they have stayed in Petsmart hotels before and it was never an issue.  They finally agreed to bring me over to their vet and to cover the cost of the visit and meds. She was given a 10 day dose of antibiotics and a topical spray because the wound was swollen and infected. I asked the manager to refund her portion of the stay as that was a pretty severe wound to have no idea about even after a nail trim and a bath the day before I picked her up.  They told me that they could do nothing more for me. Please pass this on as I want no other dog parent to have to deal with this. I personally will no longer be stepping foot in a Petsmart.

I know it's located at the corner of healthy and happy street but I don't leave there feeling overly happy or healthy. I do realize I had absolutely nothing to do with my health except to fill my prescriptions but that is what it is.

Walgreens basically replaced Eckerd's along with CVS. I don't know it's a toss-up CVS or Walgreens it really doesn't matter to me. They both off for the convenience of running in and getting some basic Staples you may need for the home which I appreciate as well as knowing my pharmacist and having my scripts are ready on time.

Service going to have to be a problem here and a slow process. Finding someone to help you locate something in the store is also another problem area. There are some items that you just can't reach, and you need some assistance. Other items are locked in cases and you have to find someone that has the key so you can end up spending much more time there than you intended to.

I agree with a couponing and they are very coupon and friendly. If there's a coupon in there monthly book that I missed the person at the register, since they know me will remind me that there's one in the book and get it for me. I think that is a good thing to do for regular customers.

Item i ordered wasnt even available at this location. So they make me wait an hour to fix the order in person (sub out the item) and an additional 20minutes to make it. They have no idea what they're doing.

For the money you pay monthly, it's a good gym. I pay $10 a month. That's like .33 cents a day! Sure, could it be cleaner? Yeah. Could it have more machines and weights? Absolutely. But for bucks you'll give out, it's definitely worth your money if you like working out.

Oh yeah, they also have free classes. I really recommend anyone who's interested in a cheap quality gym, to get a membership here. I've been going here regularly for a year now and I've never had any problems."

I've gone inside to make a purchase, as well as used the drive through for script pickup. 

For the inside purchase, one of my items had been misplaced on the shelf causing me to think it was a clearance/last chance marked down item. When I questioned the higher price, the cashier was kind enough to check the stocked item and saw the misleading price.  She adjusted the price to the ""sales"" price.  

The drive through is extremely busy. I mistakenly went at rush hour and waited so long that I drove off and came back at less busy time.  Petra at the drive through was the nicest cashier I've encountered at ANY retail store in a verrry long time.  She was working both drive thru lines solo and she still managed to be pleasant, patient and helpful.

True, most everything else this time of year is shipped in from California, but at least they're making an effort.

Kidding.

The store was well laid out and organized. We also checked out their holiday decoration section while we were in (splendid) as well as their indoor electric fireplaces (because, it's currently 23 degrees outside and it seemed like the thing to do), of which they have many. 

Since we had such luck with the medicine cabinet, we decided to see if they had a coordinating free standing shelving unit for over the loo--no such luck (but, fyi--Bed, Bath, & Beyond DID have this item).

I will say first-hand, however, that these guys work their butts off and do the best they can with the staff they have. I was here on a Friday night and my order was delayed by almost an hour. I stood there waiting and inspected their business. 

Bottom line: they need more people working at this location. The folks behind the counter were nice, efficient, and scrambling to get the pizzas out the door as fast as possible.

I can't think of a time in Nashville where I was more inspired by the hard work I witnessed in a restaurant. They need more resources from corporate to make everyone's lives easier here. Keep up the good (and hard) work!"

As a rule you can expect uppity staff who seem bothered your there and could careless about your business. I guess they figure they have the market cornered but I would rather go across the street to the Starbucks in the Target. 

They really need to take some customer service classes otherwise they need to take sometime off without pay!

The one other thing you can count on is 2 out of three visits to screw up your order. It is mind boggling how some of the servers keep their jobs, I guess it must be really hard to find people to work these days."

Ich mag sehr gerne Steaks mit Baked Potatoes und war somit hier genau richtig. 
Bereits der Eingangsbereich war sehr urig. Im Wartebereich steht ein riesiges Fass mit Erdnüssen, an dem man sich bedienen kann. Die Schalen wirft man einfach auf die Erde (ist ja der wilde Westen hier).
Dort kann man sich auch ein Bild von der einsehbaren Küche machen. Auch die verschiedenen Arten von Steaks liegen hier abgepackt in einer Vitrine, so dass man spätestens jetzt Hunger bekommt.
In unserem Fall war die Wartezeit recht kurz: am Samstag nur wenige Minuten und sonntags , als wir erneut dort waren, gab es gar keine Wartezeit. 
Beim ersten Besuch war es allerdings sehr voll. Trotzdem kam der Manager im Laufe des Besuchs zu unserem Tisch, redete ein paar nette Worte und gab uns einen Gutschein für den nächsten Besuch (die Vorspeise Blooming onion war dann kostenlos, weil wir zum ersten Mal dort waren-echt nett!).
Das Steak war super zart, ausgezeichnet und exakt so, wie man es sich ""Medium"" vorstellt. 
Zu den Preisen: Ich hatte Sirloin Steak 8 oz für $11,99, mit 2 Beilagen, die man sich aussuchen kann. Dazu Cesar`s salad und baked potato, fully loaded. Beides war perfekt! 
Das Personal trägt T-Shirts, auf deren Rückseite steht : I love my job !
Und das merkt man auch. Alle sind superfreundlich, obwohl es voll ist ohne Ende. Bei Geburtstagen von Gästen tritt das Personal an, der Gast muss auf einen Bock (Pferd) und es wird ein Ständchen gesungen. 
Es ist natürlich laut im Restaurant, aber so soll es auch sein. Ich fand`s Klasse!"

It was clean and inviting. Standing in line is something I expected, took nearly 10 minute for my turn to place an order. The menu has more selections than most fast food chains and they have a few interesting options that I would try, if I ever decide to go back. 

I waited another 14 minutes after placing my order for a to-go order, just one burger and one order of fries. By the time I got my food I was there for almost 25 minutes. There's no excuse for *fast* food to be that slow. The burger bun was very nice and a wonderful deviation from a typical burger bun. Wasn't great but was a welcome change. The fries were undercooked but tasty. The burger itself was horrible. It was cooked to death, revived and cooked to death again. Was dry and tasteless. If not for the topping it would have had no flavor at all.

I won't be back soon."

The script for my daughter's swimmers ear drops was called in around 8pm on Sunday night. Someone called to let me know that they were out but it had been ordered and would be in within a couple days. I called and called and called waiting on hold forever and ever two days in a row never being able to actually speak to anyone or calling back and getting a busy tone so I finally just drove over to the pharmacy. I was then told they were still out and they would place the order tonight and be in by Friday. I was obviously not happy to hear this and questioned why I was told they had already been ordered when they never were and now would have to wait days again. They couldn't give me an answer other than the option to call around to other CVS pharmacies and see if they could transfer it elsewhere to be filled. Unacceptable!! Needless to say I called the doctor back and had it called in again to PUBLIX and it was ready in an hour. NEVER AGAIN!

My husband and I were told we were able to drop off USPS packages there months ago (May 2020) and my husband and I continued to do so until the owner pulled us aside and asked us to start to drop off at the post office during the busy holiday season. Of course we agreed and didn't have a problem with that. She then took those packages the last day we were there since we were already in the store and we didn't think anything was wrong. 

Weeks have gone by and those packages they took that day do not have tracking. The delivery driver that picked them up that day did not scan them as he should of and now I have inventory from my business with no tracking during Christmas time. 

I went in to ask about these packages since the post office directed me to them and they would not pick up the phone as I had tried to call ahead instead of going in.

I needed to grab a gift bag for a present that I was giving to a friend at an event nearby. This location was just around the corner, so it was convenient. They have a decent sized parking lot so it was easy to get in and out. 

The store is laid out just like most others for this chain. There was a well-sized section for cards / gifts. I like that they sell bags with tissue already in it - super handy for a rush gift need like mine. 

The staff was very friendly and talked with me and my munchkin. They had a well organized store and were working on putting out Halloween items at the time. It looked nice and everything was easy to find. 

Overall: A
Convenient store with easy gift options and nice staff. Quick in and out and got what I needed."

I used to love Pizza Hut and it was so great when I was a kid. When we were seated, we couldn't help but notice how dirty everything was. The booths weren't even cleaned, the table was sticky and horrible and to top it off we waited over 45 mins for one large cheese pizza. When we got the pizza, the crust was raw and the whole thing was just a greasy mess. We couldn't even finish it because of how sick we felt. The waitress was also a bit slow, my friend asked for oregano and she handed her the red pepper flakes, this experience was one that I don't want to have again."

I noted there was another car waiting when I pulled in. The drive thru was very busy, so I felt my decision was the best one. 
I waited nearly 10 minutes and neither I nor the other car were served. The drive thru continued to be busy. I also saw several cars were pulled up into waiting areas. 
Another 5 minutes rolled around and I noted the other cars that were asked to pull up were gone. Furthermore, the drive thru was slowing down, and both of us in the delivery pickup were still without food.
Finally, at 20 minutes, the other car was serviced. I heard the young lady apologize, and say they were swamped.
At this point, I was ready to go into the restaurant. I decided to give a few more minutes, expecting my order. By thos time the drive thru had cleared out. 
Soon enough our food was delivered. It was fresh and the fries were hot. The crew member was duly apologetic, using the same reason given the other customer (""We were swamped"").
I will be hard pressed to do this again at this location. I have used it at the Bethalto store, and was promptly serviced. I considered calling management concerning my experience, but assumed that if manager was on duty, this behavior was approved."

She maintained her professionalism but she said ""well I don't know what you want me to do"" toward the end of my experience which did not really sit well with me. She also applied brow powder (makeup) to my brows to avoid doing more plucking which is not what I asked for. It seemed half-assed to me to be honest.

My wife and I sometimes like breakfast food for dinner, and this is an easy choice. On the non-food items, the parking lot has been resurfaced and striped, the landscaping is new and the building painted.  Inside, the place still needs some help, but its A LOT cleaner than it had been.  The restrooms still are terrible.

The food is much better than it had been over the last several years. I know this is all dependent on the cook in the kitchen, but the consistency is great.  Poached eggs are great (ask for an extra small dish so you can drain them), the bacon is always to our liking, the egg white omelet w/ spinach is new and a good option and on Wednesday night, they have a good special on cheeseburgers, which are very good.

All in all, not a bad spot.  Breakfast competition in the area is thin.  There's a Le Peep a couple blocks east and a Perkins a few blocks west, so its worth a look.  Lunch and dinner competition is heavy since its near a large mall, but if you feel like a Grand Slam for dinner, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

Recently I got an Impala but steering did not seem right and the car made a funny sound when started. I went back and got another car, a KIA -- beautiful car but there was a cigarette hole in passenger seat. 

Staff try to accommodate but in my opinion cars are whipped in and out so fast that proper cleaning of the glass does not happen and is easy to correct. Dirty glass smears can cause accidents if a driver is blinded by the sun while driving. Last car I had bug marks all over the front of the bonnet. Minor point perhaps, but they are easily removed with Bug and Tar remover. Cars are washed but are left to drip dry when a simple fix would be to dry them off with a chamois. Otherwise dust gets on the wet car. 

When I returned a car, I brought my concerns to the attention of a senior agent as the front desk clerk asked me ""Was everything OK?"" When I brought up the points the senior person told me ""There is no pleasing you."" I took that to mean they no longer wanted by business. I wished the other clerk a nice day and left.

 This time i spoke with the manager and told him what happened. This was new to him but he said he would exchange it again.

MOD Pizza is a franchise that is very populated in some part of the USA. The concept of the pizzeria it's a bit particular.

All pizzas on the menu are the same prices; it only depends on the size of the pizza, not on the topics. So you order a cheese pizza or a meat lover pizza at the end of the day is going to be the same price, but you also have the option to make your own pizza adding as the most topics that you want, and the price will remain the same. 

One thing that impresses me that the staff is always energetic and willing to have a talk with any of their guess, also the place is pretty big and it always clean, I can recommend this for lunchtime because there also are very fast.

They also offer a salad version with you can also add any topic for the same price."

That's the great thing about BK...the ability to customize.  And not just the ability, but they ENCOURAGE it.

And any fast food joint that thinks of people other than the chicken nugget, beefy taco, half lb burger eating type gets a giant gold star from me.  Or 3.

The pros is that it is convenient and usually carries competitive gas prices.  The cons are that the hoagies are sub-par at best (except the meatball) and the sides are not that great either (the mac and cheese might be the best).  For the morning it is nice for a quick grab of a breakfast sandwich, but the sandwiches are good in a pinch.  I would much rather go to McDonald's and get an Egg McMuffin.  WaWa does have a good selection of coffees, up to 24 oz.  They also offer discounts on refills.
Some major downsides include the fact that they are always packed, and navigating the parking lot should require an air traffic controller.  Bottom line you are getting food from a gas station, I know they really started out as convenience stores but they have merged into a conglomerate that try to carry a little bit of everything.  One thing that really irritates me about the breakfast sandwiches is that they do not have a prepared bacon, egg and cheese on an english muffin - really?  What is up with that?  In order to get a bacon, egg and cheese you have to settle for a greasy croissant, or go to the sandwich counter to order it specially - good luck with that during the morning rush!  Come on, drop the croissant's and throw it on an english muffin, they use to be a premade sandwich in the mid 90's and then they became extinct, who knows maybe they were not Y2K compatible?
Bottom line, I love when places try to experiment with new options but it isn't cool when the cut something from the past."

Confused? I just wanted to make sure you were paying attention. Obviously it is a furniture store and not a very good one.

The kind of furniture that can make the newest house look old. 

The prices are comparable to what you would find anywhere else but I am just not a fan of what they have to offer.

I checked in and let them know it was my first time, asked where the locker rooms were, etc... the manager introduced himself personally, pointed out hte locker rooms, made himself available for questions. 
This place was huge! Probably the biggest planet fitness I've been to. Most of the typical machines they had at least 2-3 of, some more! Dozens of treadmills, elipticals, gazelles, etc. All the treadmills had their own personal TV's, plus TV's around the workout area showing music videos, the time, etc. which was cool. 
Had no issues with any other patrons, everyone seemed cool and seemed ot be applying to the real ""Planet Fitness"" judgement free code, etc. There were tons of employees helping check people in, cleaning, working in the restrooms/locker rooms, etc. It was truly great. Everything was spotless clean and the equipment newer/nicer than any other location I've been to.
Those of you in the area, you are lucky to have such an amazing facility nearby. Keep in mind it is just $10/month if you are using just the one location, so it is a heck of a deal!

Having passed the restaurant almost daily, the bright blue and white exterior had never enticed me in. However, once I saw their TV ad featuring their Icelandic cod sandwich, I had to at least try it. And, boy, am I glad I did! 

I ordered that Icelandic cod sandwich, the fried shrimp and a vanilla shake to go:

The sandwich: start with the bun, which was a soft, fresh, tasty oblong hand-sized bun, containing a bed of freshly-shredded lettuce, a dollop of tartar sauce, and...one of the BEST fish fillets ever! It is a REAL fillet, lightly battered with a slightly crispy, tempura-style crust. It is not greasy, too salty, fishy-tasting nor old. They cook each sandwich TO ORDER. In short, this puts McDonald's, Burger King's and all other fish sandwiches to shame. I'm now a big fan. 

The shrimp: I got the 10 piece order...a wise decision. The shrimp were hot, plump, tasty, tender, fresh and had a very light crunchy crust that was light, not heavy and as tasty as I can remember getting in any restaurant. 
They even enclosed two fresh lemon wedges in the pack. A nice touch. And, like the fish sandwich, the shrimp were cooked fresh...TO ORDER...not pre-cooked nor laying around for hours. 

The accompanying fries were the fat-cut, softer, type. Tasty and not greasy. The vanilla shake was thick, tasty and neither too sweet nor too imitation-vanilla tasting.

Amazingly, even though this is basically a take-out restaurant, you can order your meal, take a seat in their bright and airy dining room and a waiter will deliver your order to you. 

Bottom line: this is a really nice restaurant with tasty food that is unbelievably fresh. I'm now a big fan and can recommend them to you without hesitation."

I drove over a half an hour to get to the event and once I saw Shake Shack I was veered over to it.

Lettuce, cheese, tomato, shake shack sauce, beef, and bun was what was on the Shake Shack Burger. It was great! The cheese fries aren't like other cheese fries. The sauce isn't like the standard cheddar cheese. It goes well with the crispy krinkle cut fries. The milkshake I ordered was the cherry pop milkshake. It had vanilla cola, frozen custard and Amarena cherries and pop rocks on the top! That was a premium milkshake! Two thumbs up on that one. 

I will say I saw a lot of out of state cars as I don't think Shake Shack is in all states. I would recommend trying it.

With a fucking passion. So, we took it back and just  asked for more sauce. It was only slightly better. The only difference was that this pizza was hot. Other than that, it was still the same.

Second, when the order is made and brought to you, they've usually made you the wrong type of coffee, or given you the wrong sandwich!

I'm going to call their customer service complaint line too about this particular location, because they need someone from Corporate to come out there and whip their asses into gear!  I could do a better job taking and fulfilling orders in my sleep while having the stomach flu!!!

1) this is the closest place to you at the time

So he had his manager remove it from the bill, but told me his manager wouldn't let him box it up as well.

So we left...and I had to grab a bite someplace else even after buying my kids meals, which made me mad, so I called the manager and explained what happened, and she just talked in circles about how my waiter never explained the whole situation to her. Whatever. Shit customer service. 

I guess it's just an Applebee's"

I had the Sweet Fire Chicken which were nice cuts of white meat chicken with no gristle/fat. Very tasty sauce and breading! The Chow Mein had yummy crunchy celery and onions and the broccoli had the perfect crunch and sauce. Also had the spring rolls! Yum!

I feel like this is ""my McDonald's"" and am cringing while the friendly staff members, who I have known for years,  go through this? 
       I stop using this McDonald's will they will lose business and then have to lay off workers.  I know the employees who work here work hard many of them travel and have several jobs. They've always been excellent! 
     I have Questions: what kind of compensation or bonuses will  they receive for working under these loud  crazy work conditions? I think that they must be getting massive amounts of double,  triple pay. Or stake in the ownership of the company? 
     Were the employees offered a choice? Work or not with work pause pay? 
     When I went through the drive-through it was hard to tell if people were frowning because they were wearing their Covid protective masks. I could barely hear anyone talk and yet the food came out properly and correctly.   Kudos to the employees at this McDonald's. Talk about amazing work ethic!?!!
    Why can't the construction work happen at night? Or temporarily closed down while they we conduct this (all be at much needed) renovation.

  First perk: they kept the Del Taco building, I just love it, it looks like a spaceship. 
 Second perk: There is a drive-thru and they made it accessible to the shoulder going on to 64 so you don't have to wait at the stoplights just to get back out. 
Third perk: The interior. So cool. The big ""Saint Louis"" light up logo, the all recycled wood surfaces and industrial metals with the Starbucks Reserve section is sharp. The seating is great: some high top tables, and  tables facing the all open window view. In a wrap up: it looks spiffy. 
And lastly the fourth perk: The service was stellar today. I know it is only the second day but every worker was smiling, working hard, and not complaining. Even when it was jam packed (and it definitely was) this morning at 9 AM they were bustling about but not snapping at each other while they navigated the Starbucks station.

As for the food, everything was fresh and hot when I opened it at home. The fries were crunchy and delicious, the chicken bites also have a good crunch, but lack a little flavor and are SUPER greasy.

This was my first time in Nashville and I had a gift card, so me and my friends figured why not. I'm just going to list my complaints rather than telling a narrative.

1. They refused to serve alcohol simply because the licenses we used were made of paper rather than laminated. The manager was incredibly rude about this policy, which further irritated us.

2. After the manager came over to explain that to us, our waitress disappeared until we received the check. The hostess took half our order, walked away, then came back to take the other half five minutes later.

3. Our food got mixed up and prepared incorrectly, along with the appetizers coming out after the food had already been delivered. They even informed us that the food was just sitting there under the heat lamps and they had no idea why it hadn't been brought over to us.

4. When the waitress did come back for the check, she didn't even return with any change for us. They just started bussing the table while we were still sitting down. Let me say that again: She took our money and vanished, and didn't return with the change. There were four of us, so she was not entitled to any tip for the service we were provided. We saw her twice the entire meal. To me, her taking whatever change is there is theft. Our waitress stole from us, and the manager then refused to give us her name, just saying ""Don't worry she's new"".

I fully intend to call the corporate office for not only the terrible service but the monetary theft from the waitress."

I mentioned the pasta issue to her and she asked if there was anything she could do.  I'm never sure how to answer that question, honestly.  I didn't want to re-order, since I'd had enough to satisfy my appetite, and I don't enjoy desserts.  Perhaps they could have comped my drink or something, but I'd prefer that offer be made rather than demanding it.  

I will probably go back to try something else as everyone else seems to be reviewing it highly and I suspect my limp pasta was just an ""oops"" moment in the kitchen.

We often customize our orders to fit the hubs being a vegetarian (-beef, sub beans), and we've had our fair share of receiving wrong orders. However, we can't remember ever having our order mixed up at this location. Plus, the workers always seem speedy and pleasant. 

So, when coming home from the north, we almost always bypass the Taco Bell a few exits north in favor of hitting up this one!

So when I asked if they could please make me a egg mcmuffin without egg yolk, they informed me that they ""Do not do that here""  Seriously? It takes two seconds to separate egg yolk from an egg. Do you need me to show you? 

When I asked if the 'gentleman' taking my order would go check, he pauses for two seconds, and then says once again ""they do not do that here"" when I say two seconds, I mean two seconds, I didn't even have time to say thank you for ""Checking with a manager"".  

When I asked for the manager, ""we do not have a manager on duty right now"" Bull crap.

On top of that, they consistently get my order wrong in the drive through, and when I come back and show my receipt they are less than apologetic about it. Whoever hires at this macdonalds seriously needs to reevaluate who the hell they are hiring."

Before I go to the service aspect of this review, its worth pointing out that this location is full service.  You can pack and ship, get a PO box, passport services, etc.  Their hours are rather standard, but also have time on Saturday if you can't fit them in during the week.  Remember, rates are based on destination zip code and weight  (outside of flat rate offerings).  You can get an idea on shipping costs ahead by checking out the USPS website.

Getting to that service bit.  I've twice come here a bit lost and confused about which method would be best (i.e. cheapest but safest) to get my package to its final destination.  The first time, as I scouted out boxes which I'd have to pay for, staff volunteered to help find me a 'free' box.  Rather than buy a box ($4) or go for the higher cost shipping of a flat rate box (none of which seemed to fit anyway), she advised me on the priority boxes available, helped estimate the cost ahead of packing, and even provided tape once we found a workable box. The second time was a different employee, which I knew now to ask, but went out of her way in a similar manner as well.

'Snail mail' may not be a method I use often in today's electronic age. Still, it is good to know when needed, the good old postal service can come through in the clutch!"

I'm glad I didn't write them off completely because, as of my last visit a couple weeks ago, the quality seems to have leveled out to be more on par with other locations. Service was also extremely friendly and fast.

I was pretty much locked in after a few minutes. The traffic overflowed onto the street behind the restaurant. Two cashiers were taking orders outside and another ran out the receipts. After paying we had to merge into one lane since there's only one drive thru window. My food was ready but I would expect it to be after sitting in over 20 minutes of traffic. The only reason I'm rating this joint three stars instead of one is that my grilled nuggets were the best they've ever tasted! Perhaps it was starvation taking over but I found them flavorful, tender, juicy, and well portioned. I'd love to get them again but it won't be this location on a Saturday.

Service: Each time I have been, they've been prompt, friendly and reliable. I'm pleased. Remember, it's honestly mostly high school kids working, so for what it is, they do a great job.

I don't know, I guess having carpet really makes the store seem more warm and comforting than having shiny floor tiles.

The people here have never given me a hassle about anything I have ever asked for.  For the most part they are willing to help.  Whenever I look at the employees in any Pharmacy, Pharmacists included, I am just happy I don't work in the industry any more.  It is a brutal life.  You are surrounded by sick people, so you get sick.  Then you still have to go to work because you are almost a one man show in a smaller pharmacy, and for me personally, my District Manager was a tyrant.  It seems like the buyers for CVS keep their store managers busy because there always seems to be a Plan O Gram reset in progress.  A POG is the diagram of the spacing of products in an aisle.  Most people in retail hate these because a simple addition to an aisle requires you to rearrange usually, at least 4 feet of product.  What a brutal life.  

Like any corporation profit is the main goal, CVS, however does have standards in reaching that goal, and I respect them over all other chain pharmacies for that.  They don't sell tobacco products.  They are congruent in their mission.
Anyway, the point is that the employees in this location work hard, they do what they have to get the job done and they seem happy to help despite the work load.  I send all my scripts here and they are efficient at filling them as well.  I just want to give credit where credit is due."

Maybe I'm expecting too much?  Unfinished projects that I paid a finished price for remain incomplete or not installed as advertised.  The filth and debris they leave behind is inexcusable.  Such a disappointment.
When they call to check on their install, if you disagree with how things went they hang up on you.  They really don't care about the consumer, they merely go through the motions.
Just can't bring myself to go back there now."

Tonight my app confirmed the scheduled order pickup for 645pm and I did not get my food until 815pm. They were so behind on pick up orders that they even closed down the walk in line - only online orders were allowed. How does that happen at a ""fast food"" restaurant? Some people even canceled their pickup order because the line was obviously a faster way to get their food. They were turned away and told to wait. Oh and the best part was, once they smartened up and used both serving lines, the manager started preparing food for the 730pm orders - so everyone from 6-730 (still waiting for their order) was stuck in a longer wait line than people that ordered their food after them! 

Management was no help. They complained they were under staffed. Not only can you not keep up with 30-50 patrons, you lost another 25 as they trickled in to the walk in line only to be turned away. How that place makes money is astonishing. 

Lastly - the portions are easily half what they are at other chipotles. Not an exaggeration - HALF. Do yourself a favor and go to another chipotle or eat somewhere else."

Thankfully we read the tip that suggested calling ahead to put your name on the waiting list. When we arrived we noticed that the waiting list was very long but we were seated immediately. 

Our waitress recommended getting the Monkey Bread ($12.50) and Funnel Fries ($8.00) for appetizers. The four of us never had dessert type items as appetizers but decided to take her advice. The Monkey Bread was phenomenal but extremely over the top for me. I had a bite or two and left it for the others. The Funnel Fries were also very good. They came with a side of caramel dipping sauce that kicked it up a notch. 

For sandwiches we all ordered something different and shared. My favorite was the Roger's Rockin Rueben with fries. ($18.00) The corned beef was delicious and the rye bread was very fresh. Our waitress said that they make their own Russian dressing. It was flavorful and really enhanced the sandwich. My second favorite was the Ty's Two Fister. ($13.00) This sandwich has house smoked  pastrami, corned beef, Swiss cheese and also served on rye bread. It is finished with a little Honeycup mustard. I disliked the Cheesy Todd. ($15.00) It is a ground brisket and short rib hamburger with jalapeño Mac & Cheese ""buns."" It was sloppy and it had a processed cheese aftertaste. Everyone at the table disliked the Schmacon Me Crazy sandwich. ($13.00) It is pimento cheese spread, burnt scallion ranch, fried pickles and candied Schmacon.

This is the McDonald's in the shopping center at Bell Shoals and Bloomingdale.  Seems to be mostly a drive through location, but I ate in to give it a fair shake.  This is a location where you can place your own order at a touch screen, though I opted for a live order taker.  This was a bit of a mistake, as the person was clearly new.  They were cheerful enough, but taking the order took quite a bit of time.

I ordered their new 1/4 pound hamburger with just cheese and onions.  It was delivered to the table barely after I sat down.  It didn't live up to the image in the commercial, as it was overcooked, not juicy at all.  Other than that it was a standard McDonald's experience.  Fries were good, but hardly and salt (unusual as if there is a complaint with the fries it is usually too much salt).  Coca Cola fountain drink was fine, i.e. they had the syrup mix right.

Saw a guy smoking a cig at the far end of the bar (thank goodness) and another closer with a pipe that didn't smell too bad.

Much of the waitstaff are pretty good-looking, and our bartender (Shannon) was no exception. She seemed aloof at first, until later, when she warmed up. (She was the only staff member behind the bar so maybe it was hard to pay attention to us?) She made me a lemon drop shot that was decent (believe me, I've had worse). The new location now can serve liquor (not just beer) so that's a plus.

We took advantage of half-off wings during happy hour. We each had an order of medium wings done dry (not wet - that is, completely dipped in sauce). The wings were typical Hooters, generally crunchy, somewhat seasoned - and nothing you haven't had before.

Maury's not a complete hermit though, and when it comes time to grab groceries he enjoys the fun back and forth with the nice people that check him out and bag his stuff. 

Even though the place smells like a 1963 community demonstration and has more armpit hair than the whole of 4th avenue, Maury gave in to the BO stank for stuff at Whole Foods on Speedway. He could deal with the fact that nobody asked him if he needed help when trying to track down coconut oil, and Maury could deal with the silly prices, higher than AJs in many cases, but Maury just about lost it when he went to pay for his items and Jason, the guy checking him out up front, decided the book he was reading was too good to put down. No acknowledgement, no nothing. Just the slowest service you can imagine (it's hard to ring up items and read) void of eye contact or any personal connection. Maury almost felt like saying something, but would Jason pause, look up, care? Probably not. And that was alright with Maury, because he knew he'd be getting in the car to go back home where he works for that website, Velp, that connects people to lovable local businesses, and he knew he'd tell Tucson how much this one sucks.

They were grossly understaffed, for example, there was only one person on the sandwich board making sandwiches, just one at a time and would walk them over to the drive through station...one at a time. No one was toasting buns for the sandwiches...so she would toast the buns before she started to make the next sandwich. The order taker was a professional statue, he did not assist in any way. Nobody manned the fry station, the whole situation was beyond rediculous. I asked the order taker to cancel my order and take my charge off of my credit card, and he did not know who to do that. He told the manager I wanted to cancel my order, and the manager told the order taker that he was too busy to do it for him. So the order taker simply ignored me and stood around some more.

The service is fabulous; talk about some super-friendly people. The burgers are absolutely delicious, and I love the variety of toppings you can choose from. I got positively giddy over all my choices. There's a ""build-your-own"" option to ensure you get all your favorites on there, and then some pre-created ones if you're just feeling hungry and not creative. Hooray for Fitz's bottled sodas, and they serve wine and beer here, as well, which I can't decide whether it works here, but I guess it's cool that they offer it.

The only downside was that I had such slippery ingredients on my burger (such as the caramelized onion and avocado) that as soon as I picked up my burger it completely fell apart. :( Guess that's my fault, though. But it tasted just as delicious in pieces.

They have sweet potato fries! Always exciting as far as I'm concerned.

They had a friggin' gooey butter cake shake, which I'm definitely going to have to try next time. Sounds amazing.

If you like Mexican, made fresh to order, quickly you have to check it out!!

I like how they keep their prepared and ready to serve portions small so everything is always fresh. They don't keep a ton of cooked proteins ready to serve. This helps to ensure your proteins were not cooked hours ago. 

Love it!! Keep it up!!"

My last nerve today. I tried to pick up an order that my husband made on their website. It was before 4pm, which is the less than normal chaotic crowd. Asked three desks where to pick up my order to be told that I couldn't get it because I was not authorized to on the order. I suggested calling my husband to get verification, and still got a big fat SOL from the monotone associate.

Chang's in St. Charles. It was a little late and I didn't want to order too much so I ordered a cup of Hot N Sour soup and an order of the 4 pork dumplings in chili oil. My boyfriend ordered the Lo Mein. He was debating with the waiter whether the chicken or beef would be better and he went with the beef.  My soup came out first and it was good although it could have been a touch hotter. A food runner brought out the rest of the food a few minutes later. Lo Mein with chicken (not beef as ordered) and 4 Pork Eggrolls (not dumplings as ordered.)  I immediately told the runner I ordered the dumplings and not the eggrolls. She removed the eggrolls and I sat there watching my date eat the chicken Lo Mein he did not order. When the waiter stopped by he mentioned that the dumplings I decided I wanted would be out shortly. I said I ordered the dumplings and that he had ordered the beef Lo Mein and received chicken. Another five or so minutes later I received the dumplings which were OK. A few minutes later a whole dish of beef Lo Mein came out and we asked that it just be boxed up. When the waiter brought the check he took the Lo Mein off the bill which was nice. This was a mediocre and disappointing meal though. I feel like he just totally didn't listen to what we were ordering. I would not return.

Friendly, fun, not frighteningly fast or slow, a bit indifferent and a little scripted... If rating this place on the service alone, I'd say 3 stars. 

Meaty, large, substantial, incredibly filling, pretty tasty but not amazing... If rating this place on the food alone, I'd say 4 stars.

Crunchy, salty, messy, roasty, and reminiscent of the ballpark... If rating this place on the peanuts alone, well no one is reviewing this place on the peanuts!

Overall, Texas Roadhouse is prime example of a chain done well. There are some things that are fantastic, like the rolls and peanuts, but there are other things that are just done ok, and for me, that has been the food. 

This last visit I ordered a half rack of ribs, which for the money, is significant value. It's about 4-5 LARGE spareribs, smoked and finished on the grill. They're lightly sauced, which is a huge plus, but they tasted a bit acrid, as if the fire got a little too hot during cooking. It produces a smoked flavor that comes across as artificial, and not really palatable. My wife had the half bbq chicken, which was awesome, and was even better the next day! 

All in all, Texas Roadhouse is one of those places that lives in the back of mind for that moment when you just need something ""safe"" and consistent. And while I wish the food was going to get me all pumped up, it's really the rolls I come for! 

PRO-TIP: Always ask for some of those bad boys to go!"

The customer service was really good besides the shortage of syrups to not be able to make the original drink I wanted!

I also usually have a hard time getting the correct order. Either I don't get a straw or I get the wrong thing all together. I have also gotten quite a few watered down nasty drinks from this location.

I worked at Starbucks for a few years and this was never something I had heard of. Regardless, I wasn't asking for 4 oz of milk, maybe 3 at the most if it was filled to the standard amount in a grande cup, which I can tell you is not actually 16 oz.

I came here for a work sponsored lunch with a group of 8 people.  Yes, I realize that typically means an automatic tip.  If service was half-way decent, I would have left as much if not more myself anyway.  Instead, we had to wait nearly 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order and another 10 minutes for her to bring our drinks out.  After taking our orders, the food came out in a reasonable period, and then we never saw our server again, until I had to flag her down for the check, which took another 5 minutes to retrieve.  I expected a bit more attention given the restaurant was nearly empty and it was the lunch hour.  Normally, I would have argued to have the tip removed, but we were all running late thanks to the ""extended"" poor service.  Instead, my next monthly work sponsored outing will be at Millers down the street.

Apparently, the kiosk was broken.  We get the attention of the clerk, Austin, and he tells us that he can print them manually.  So he stops stocking the shelves, hurries up to the front counter, scans our card and prints out some coupons.  Much to our dismay though, the coupon we wanted wasn't included.

Before leaving we also had to try the pastry part of Prep & Pastry. So I ordered the blueberry & earl grey tea scone. I was skeptical about tea IN my scone rather than with it but it blew my mind.

Thomas and Christian the Pharmacist here are awesome! They take the time to answer all medication questions (even when they know I'm an RN). The staff here are always friendly, greets me by my name, and acknowledges me when I'm near the counter.

Wawa's gas prices are no longer the cheapest in town - the Thorntons gas station two blocks away usually offers lower. This station seems to have issues with their pumps - I was there during rush hour one night, and all the pumps would only let you get $10 worth of gas, that you had to pay inside for. What a hassle. I told the manager when I went in to pay, and it still took her about 20 minutes to try and solve the problem, with at least ten customers complaining to her. As others have said, you will definitely be approached by people asking for money; it's happened the last three times I was getting gas. I bought a fruit cup from their packaged to-go section, and it had bad pieces in it by the next day. I feel like their candy inventory is very hit or miss - they didn't even have Swedish fish last night.

Thankfully, they still carry Old Bay potato chips, which are hard to get in Florida. And the subs are still pretty good, even if they never seem to have enough people actually making them during the dinner hour.  But, due to all the issues, I no longer go out of my way to purchase gas here."

My wife and I walked in to the nearly empty restaurant and wondered where everybody was.  We were seated and began to peruse the menu.  The food choices looked very appetizing on the menu, so we were ready to have a good meal.  We ordered two appetizers.  Fried Cheese and Pretzels with Beer Cheese.  When they showed up, the portion sizes were appalling.  Four little sticks of Fried Cheese and two little Pretzel Sticks with enough Beer Cheese for three times that or more.  The price to portion ratio was way off.  I ordered a burger and it showed up with NOTHING on it but Cheese.  No lettuce, no tomato, no onion, NOTHING.  I could have gone to McDonalds and gotten a better burger with more fixings on it.  It was quite insulting, really.  We got the bill, and realized we were about to be out nearly 40 bucks for this rather miserable meal.  Major rip off.

It was then that we realized why the place was so empty.  Everyone else was somewhere else, hopefully getting their money's worth.

The two stars I gave here in this review are for the very friendly serving staff.  Props to you folks.

Come on, folks.  For nearly 40 bucks you simply MUST do better than this.  Unacceptable."

Very loud and rude did she ask ""Is this WIC or Food Stamps"" and even though a portion of my purchase was WIC she didn't know that because I had other non WIC items as well. I tell her it is WIC and she says to the lady at the next register ""This lady has WIC come do this""  The cashier comes over to help and they proceed to have a conversation RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME about how they dont have assistance and if people worked they wouldn't have to be doing all of this extra work.

The second time I returned to the front counter and asked if there was a way to warm up my burrito and the nice girl gave me a to-go container and said I'd probably have to warm it up at home.

Turns out that dragonfruit must provide some dragonfruit flavor!!

No 1/2 price last hour. No ""buy $3+ coffee and get free sandwich"".
No ""receipt lottery"" 1 hour before close (name on receipt, goes into hat, pull the winner)
No donation to shelter or company.
They can't even wrap it in a separate trash bag and leave it next to trash pile.

Compared to Coffee Bean in California that announced, 15 mins to close, that the following sandwiches have today's expiration date and anyone who wishes to take them may do so.
They were good sandwiches. Not $6 ones but $3.50 ones.

Starbucks is so corporate that they waste stuff left and right. The staff is usually as wooden as Pinocchio- this location was different (dude with full beard knows his stuff and is chiller than a morgue corpse)

Recycle.
Donate/raffle/secondarily discard the day old food.

SB is the Walmart of coffee.
Too big for their own good."

I ordered half a bacon turkey bravo and when I went to grab it at the window they gave me a full sandwich. This isn't the worst mistake, because I didn't mind taking half home to eat later, but the sandwich itself was sub par compared to the same sandwich at other locations. The lettuce was completely limp and the tomatoes had yet to turn. If a chain restaurant promises fresh ingredients and fresh bread that's what you would expect, but instead I got microwaved bacon, lunch meat, and bad lettuce and tomato."

I ordered my go to pick two, I love that you can mix and create your own combo. As always it was delicious. Napa Almond Chicken Salad & the mac & cheese. I had always heard how good it was and wanted to try it for myself. The only problem is that its not diet friendly. I also liked they had 6 fresh brewed teas and lemonades.

This part is more for the developer/planner of the location who clearly has never before designed a parking lot for a popular drive thru coffee shop.

The entrance/lobby is small and became cluttered easily with guests entering, leaving and waiting. 

Once we were seated I noticed they there were several unoccupied tables. Perhaps they were short on servers. Maybeeee that was due to everyone being hungover from the NYE's festivities the night before. :)

Anyhoo, our server was prompt and pleasant. We knew immediately what we wanted to eat since we checked out the menu during our wait. Decent food. I requested to substitute my pancakes with french toasts. There was an upcharge. My friend's omelette 'Bacon Sensation' or something like that definitely lacked bacon.

Just how fast is this store?

Today I ordered just the basic and legendary CFA sandwich with lettuce and tomato and no cheese (Yes, you can still do that for an additional 30 cents without paying the full deluxe upcharge) and my order was placed in front of me before the debit card reader was done with my card. 

I actually said to myself, ""They probably forgot the lettuce and tomato because this came out so fast!"" Yet, my quick stop to check it when grabbing napkins and ketchup confirmed my sandwich was 100% accurate. 

Sure, I usually hit this location well after the lunch rush of people who work nearby at USF, but my multiple counter visits here have been faster than any other CFA in Hillsborough County.

Why not five stars? I had scheduled an 8am pickup, which was the earliest they could arrange and already had me an hour late for work. As I waited at the repair shop the very knowledgeable girl told me she'd call 'just to check'.

I'm glad she did, apparently an 8am pickup means all of crap, you have to get there and call before they'll come for you. Very annoying, especially if the CollisionMax staff didn't know. I'd still be sitting there!

A place like OG can easily be ripped to shreds if you really wanted to go there, and normally I would, but its not worth it. The service we received was fast and friendly, a potentially meal-ending snafu was handled quickly and graciously (hair in a salad), and with the gift card the total outlay was a whopping $7.

Applebees has taken its place as a well utilized restaurant in the Village of Newtown Shopping Center.  It follows the national formula and does not deviate beyond the mean.

This is one of the biggest Starbucks in the area. We love the large tables but there is plenty of seating all around the coffee shop. Wifi is free and it connects quickly to all my wifi eating devices: pad, phone,laptop.

The coffee is typical Starbucks. I am more of a Dunkin Donut's coffee guy but here there are three choices of regular to blend into the largest cup they have - that one cup lasts for the whole meeting.

(For those of you who do not watch the news, ALL Romaine has been recalled due to several people in multiple states falling ill from E. Coli traced to...Romaine lettuce from Salinas, CA.) 

Appalled, I waited for our server to return when I ask if I was looking at ROMAINE lettuce. Yes, I was, but this batch has been cleared and is safe to eat. Another staff member also stopped by to inform that this was a safe batch. Ok, I figured I have several witnesses at my table, should I fall I'll.

I ate my mini/pseudo ""Wedge"" Salad, which by the way is normally served on a WEDGE of ICEBERG LETTUCE for Pete's sake.

The manager stopped by the table and I asked once more about the ROMAINE. He kindly informed that the lettuce was from Arizona. Now, why wasn't I told that vital bit of info five questions ago?! No bueno!

The last time I went I remember the menu being outta-control-huge.  Like hundreds of items.  It looks like they've scaled the menu back quite a bit which I enjoyed.  The old menu was overwhelming! 

I got the $16.99 sirloin and shrimp dinner which came with five shrimp on a skewer, a four ounce sirloin, and two sides.  I chose garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli for my sides and added a house salad for just $1.99 extra.  The steak was just about as bad as I remember...it's all kind of the same color on the inside which is weird.  It did have a good flavor and wasn't too tough, however.  The shrimp were juicy and cooked just perfectly with a nice charred flavor.  The broccoli was steamed perfectly and the mashed potatoes were so fresh and garlicky....I loved them!  I give this meal a 3/5.  

My son got a kid's meal for 99 cents so I chose the corn dog with applesauce.  Not a bad deal for less than a buck!  

Applebee's is surprisingly not as bad as I remember.  But it still isn't great."

CHYEAH! You better believe it.

This Chick-fil-A has been my trusty friend on those long days where cooking isn't an option and waffle fries are calling my name. Their service is quick and friendly! And if they mess up your order, they make it right...and then some. 

My roomie and I picked up dinner here (via the drive-thru) a few weeks ago. When we got home (we live less than a mile away) we realized that they left out one of our orders of fries. We drove back through and told them that they left out a medium fry. They apologized and when we got to the window they gave us a large fry and a coupon for a free entree during our next visit!

Now on to the food - it's always served hot and fresh! Each visit I've had here has been consistently excellent. As far as what to order, well, everyone has their preference at Chick-fil-A. But if you ask me, get a Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich, fries, Chick-fil-A sauce, ranch, and if you've thrown calorie counting out the window, an Oreo milkshake...and feel no regrets. But if you are counting calories and are looking for something semi-guilt-free (is that even a real thing??), I love their chicken cool-wraps with balsamic vinaigrette and a small fry on the side (because how could I not?), so yummy!"

I have also utilized the onsite Take Care clinic.  I have stopped by twice, over the years, due to a sinus infection that needed immediate attention.

I made the appointment with Take Care online and saw the nurse practitioner later the same day. There was no wait time and she was as pleasant as she was knowledgeable.

We have always chosen to purchase food and treats from this location for our three cats. I think the litter options and prices are elevated above other purchasing options so I don't buy litter from Petsmart.

Recently we brought a new kitten into our lives. Having an older cat and a kitten is hard from a food standpoint so we opted for canned food for the kitten until he hits 1 year of age. 

Petsmart has been great. I was paying $1.50 per can of food at the vet. I stopped into Petsmart for treats and stumbled upon his brand of canned food - Hill's Ideal Balance - for only $0.99 a can! Score! I went a tad crazy and bought 40 cans. I took them to the register and the employee and I chatted while he rang them up. Then, after scanning all the cans, he added a 10% discount because, as he said, ""kittens can be expensive.""

I've been back every two of so weeks since bringing our kitten home and they always have plenty of options in the brand and all for the same great price. No additional discounts on my recent visits but the customer service is still on point - despite weekend crowds on several of my visits.

What frustrates me is that she acted like she took the number and I declined a receipt, like many people are right now. So I can't just add the receipt number myself. Pretty disappointing."

She finally let us in at 7:18 without speaking to us and never offered any explanation or apology.  She barely spoke the whole time we were there.  This is my first Yelp review.  I don't usually complain, but her behavior was ridiculous.  I understand that people can be late, have a bad day, etc.  But, all she had to do was let us in out of the cold (it was 20 degrees this morning) and say, ""I'm sorry--I'll be with you in a few minutes.""  That's all we needed.  We'll never visit this Subway again."

Such as a small quesadilla and small salad. Well, this was gone :( So I ordered a children's quesadilla and added fajita peppers. It came with a drink and tortilla chips for only $4.30 with tax!!! The quesadilla was excellent, but the Pico di Gallo on the side was super bland! Usually the Pico is really good here.

They recognized you and would remember your order. They also asked YOU if you wanted the mall discount (provided you were wearing a nametag or some other obvious sign you were an employee there). There were a couple of other people who worked there who weren't nearly as nice or quick and one of them waited til' a day when the other ladies weren't there to tell me they don't even do a mall discount. Knowing that she was lying, I reminded her that she herself had given me one the week before (coincidently when the little Asian ladies were there).

Every time I step into a Walmart I'm usually reminded why I don't shop there. Yes, the prices may be cheaper than what you find anywhere else, but the clientele can make me a little uneasy. A couple people seemed like they were on drugs (including an employee). This could just be their personality, but I still don't want to be around if they start going through withdrawal.

The good news is this is a clean Walmart. If I was just walking down the aisle in my own little bubble, I would find nothing wrong with the merchandise. It was around Easter and they even had giant stuffed minions with bunny ears for around $22! I didn't know I needed that, but I needed it.

Even though this is a huge store, you still may not find everything you need. We were looking for a specific type of light bulb (my husband knows what we were looking for, I just know it looks like a swirly coil instead of the bulb) and we were unable to find it. 

In the parking lot, a car actually swerved around us to pull in front to let passengers out (and I'm talking slow-moving passengers). It would have made more sense for them to just let us leave, and, you know, follow normal traffic patterns, but again, that's the clientele that comes here.

Not to mention, there isn't much value for the quality/quantity of food you get compared to similar restaurants in the area. 

The restaurant felt dingy and our booth was a bit sticky and grimy.  Service was pretty average and the Grilled Chicken on the Barbie I had was actually flavored very well.  I did substitute the mixed vegetables for 4 sprigs of asparagus, which resulted in an upcharge for some reason.  Also, for an entrée that included a breast of chicken and four asparagus, I don't know that $20 seems like a good deal."

At the same time, I often just need to get things that I don't have time to find at a local place. A tea pot. Tupper ware. Furniture. Work shirts. New gym shorts. Some food.

Okay, I like Target. It doesn't have that ghetto feel that Wal-Marts have. I mean sometimes I want to see that, and Wal-Mart entertains me when I am in the mood (or have been drinking).

Visiting a Cracker Barrel reminds one of simpler days. Full blown Americana exemplified by farming equipment hung overhead, pictures, advertising signs by businesses no longer operating and a barrage of colors. Oh, almost forgot, Cracker Barrel serves food.

I ordered one sunny-side-egg, sausage, dry toast, and black coffee. The egg and sausage were perfectly cooked and hot. The toast was browned nicely. The coffee was hot and as I requested, black. Normally, the server provides sugar or sweetener with cream despite my order of black coffee. This time, just the coffee. The coffee was better the previous visit.

As I was paying for the breakfast, I asked the cashier to add the cost of Goldberg's peanut chews that was beckoning. I'm a prime example why perfectly placed items for quick purchase works. 

The next time I visit Cracker Barrel, maybe I'll play a game of checkers on the porch seated next to the row of rocking chairs.

The frozen hot chocolate was made very quickly, but ended up still tasting good. The staff member was also nice and threw in a couple of free Munchkins.

I had the donut inside of the restaurant and even though it was fairly late in the day, it still tasted nice as fresh.

I ordered 8 wings and lemon pepper fries.  Let's start with the location, the employees at the location are clearly ready to go home from work. They are loud obnoxious and only acknowledges me AFTER the cashier finds his phone.  My food was not done when I came to pick it up as I ordered online.  Small wait, no issues.  My food finally arrives, I usually check it but I decided not too.  Once I get home to eat my food, the wings tasted aweful, I had to put my own sauce on them to finish them and the fries were cold as ever. Definitely could tell theses were the last of the fries that they were just trying to get rid of.  This brought back my initial memory of my experience with this place and why I do not eat here.

I got 10 pieces of chicken. They weren't big, and most of them were wings. But I got a good thigh (like I need more of that) and good customer service (for which I am always grateful). And the chicken tasted great, probably because I hadn't had either lunch or dinner. But it hit the spot.

People that will enjoy this: previous Panda Express fans, people who like the convenience factor

Otherwise, if you're looking for good American Chinese food, this probably won't cut it for you. Everything was super sweet--I definitely needed hot sauce to cut through the orange chicken and Beijing beef. I know these are traditionally sweet dishes, but in my opinion this was sickly sweet. The best part of my meal was the chow mein--I like the al dente texture and more balanced seasoning. 

Customer service was great though! They offered samples of food and greeted people enthusiastically. Seating seems ample. 

Panda Express fans know what they are getting themselves into, but for others, sample some foods first to check out if you like the taste!"

I went with the regular which is actually two patties.  I also chose ""all the way"" which was everything in black on the menu for toppings.  Off the top of my head, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, pickles, mustard, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms.  Wow, this was a freakin big burger.  Next time I'll go with the small (one patty)

The burger was pretty good.  I can say that my taste in burgers has definitely been skewed by the fancy burgers I get downtown.  This is a whole 'nother category.  This is like a fast food burger but with really fresh toppings.  Sure they give you two, but it sits pretty damn heavy.  The bun was nothing to speak of.  It was a bit soggy by the time I ate it because it soaked up the stuff that was on my burger.

The fries are great!  When you walk in they have 50lb bag of potatoes on the right hand side and they even have a small chalkboard showing you which farm they are from.  Nice touch, I like that.  When you eat them, they aren't battered, just cooked properly.  Crispy outside, soft inside.  Everything a good fry should be.

So I'll be back.  I'll tone down the burger order and most likely enjoy my experience a bit more."

They told me that my call had likely been sent to the call center and the call center had most likely sent my pizza to a different location. I called the call center and they have no record of my order either.

The fact is, I recognized the voice of the guy working the counter when I went in. I have no doubt that he ""took"" the order. When I got to be visibly frustrated he told me it was his 2nd day on the job.

Finally I placed another order that was supposed to be ready in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I had a pizza and some cheese bread I didn't order (I ordered cheese sticks)...

This is the most worthless place. If you work here, do your future a favor and quit. I swear to God this place is like the Twilight Zone.

And then the food came--not the delivery person's fault; the food was still warm/hot. They were apologetic, although it wasn't their fault. Tips were still given.

Now, I've never really had Papa John's before; my husband generally likes it. When we started eating, he commented that hunger improves the taste of things.

If you're entering from the rear of the building when you open the front door the next door you should open should be to your immediate right to get in the line; the door in front of the first door you just opened takes you right to the dining room. 

I wasn't He-Man hungry so I got a kids meal and it came with lots of fixings, under $5 and just the right portion if you're trying to watch those holiday calories (I want to save on my calorie consumption for big festive meals and alcohol). The chicken (Sweet Fire Chicken) was juicy and flavored well with Chow Mein noodles (very dry if that makes any sense). Overall, this is a definite winner and I would certainly come back or even place a call in order on my way home.

They always are running special and we tried one, The Country Fried Steak Benedict. It was pretty good. Didn't knock my socks off with the meat but the gravy and biscuits were top notch.

Since moving to Seminole this year, I've purchased several thousand of dollars of building materials here.  This can readily be seen from my credit card account, linked to my address and phone number at home depot.  Nonetheless, when I went this week to buy a dishwasher, alot of 2x4s, a door and miscellaneous, again totaling over $1,000, this store refused free delivery of everything to my house, 3.5 miles away, along with the dishwasher delivery that was included.  Breana in customer service literally rolled her eyes when I pleaded whether store manager wouldn't agree on this sized purchase, and I couldn't get door and 2x4s home in my sedan.  Oh no, they were greedy for the $75 fee to go 3.5 miles, so I ended up buying everything and the dishwasher from S. Clearwater Lowes.  Further, but has staff like Joe who's voluntarily helpful and cares to make sales.  I was already awaiting flooring delivery there, and they had no problem including the addl items for free.  Smart business decision and a new loyal Lowes customer with investment properties to boot.  Finally, Home Depot spitefully mis-entered my phone number and address (which I saw was originally correct in the system but obviously changed later on).  Sefallly, said she was operations manager, never called back to let me know if delivery rescheduled, etc.  

Stock investors and corporate Home Depot - stores like this will slowly erode your whole franchise value!  My contractors were appalled too, and now all big purchases to Lowes S Clearwater going forward."

The hostess who was very nice stopped by to check on us, but was not knowledgeable about the products they serve.  She asked about Alaskan King Crab legs and said most customers get the snow crab because it's sweeter--WHAT?  They get it because it's, um, cheaper.  Alaskan King are the sweetest ...

Starbucks review Keep it up baristas! always friendly and professional, speedy service.

Originally, Starbucks offered only two sizes: short (8 ounces) and tall (12 ounces). When the company added grande, venti and trenta, they kept the old names for the original drinks. 

At most Starbucks around the world, the size options are: short (8 ounces), tall (12 ounces), grande (16 ounces), venti (24 ounces), and trenta (31 ounces). Grande is Italian for 'large,' venti means 'twenty,' and trenta is 'thirty'. After a trip to Italy in 1983, founder Howard Schultz became obsessed with its coffee bars and wanted to introduce Italian names. 

As customers demanded larger sizes, 'short' was taken off the menu board so the larger sizes of 'venti' and 'trenta' sizes could be added Tall ended up becoming the smallest sized drink on the printed menu."

I had to call AAA because honestly, I know very little about changing a flat tire and I was in my work clothes that I didn't want to ruin.

The next time I asked if they would cut my pizza because last time they didn't, and they said yes, they'll cut it. Then right in front of me the man just joked with the person cutting the pizza.

Today, I ordered for a couple friends, and it take literally five minutes to get everything right. First they charged more than they should, then they got the order wrong again by not giving me another drink, and when I asked for cupholders she didn't give me one at first. It was a struggle to hold everything, my card, my wallet, trying to get everything in. She gave me the drinks and then the cupholders.

Dumb thing to do but at least I learned something new.

Costs for the injections, check-ups, etc are more than fair and there's an electronic sign-in kiosk that keeps everyone in order and (at least to me) makes things a bit more efficient once you do walk into the nurse's office. It can get very busy on the weekends so don't think you can walk in and see the nurse or think an hour is enough. On weekends, the nurse's schedule will be booked up for the entire day by noon. Oh, it's also pretty cool if it's busy you don't have to wait there. You can go out and as long as you're within 30 mins to the location, you're good because they'll send you a text when it's close to your appointment.

What does really suck about this Starbucks is not the location but how is situated on the edge of Hillsborough and Memorial Highway. I am surprised that there has never been any major accidents during rush hour traffic with people trying to get their morning cup of joe. Even when it's not rush hour the parking lot is ridiculously small and the curve that you have to take to swing into the drive thru is bonkers! 

When I'm in a time crunch or just feel like taking the chance and not heading the other direction to another Starbucks I'll shoot to this location. If you're looking for a lot of seating... negative! If you're even looking for a space to park your car...head to another Starbucks!

Lots of great memories of RL when growing up means it'll always have a special place in my soul. I don't visit often anymore, but when I do, I'm generally surprised at how much I still like the food.

The woodfire-grilled trout is one of my favorites these days, although it was slightly overcooked and not quite as tasty at this location as I've had at other RLs in Indy (3.5 stars of 5). Baked potato was fine (3 stars) and the asparagus was just mediocre (2.5 stars). Cheddar biscuits were superb as usual (4.5 stars). One odd thing is that they've stopped including a salad with your meal ...if you want one now, you have to order it as one of your sides. Weird.

All in all, a good but not great experience. Friendly (but slow) service, solid food, reasonable prices and portions. This location is decent but if given the choice, I'd rather visit the Avon or 38th St locations instead."

I prepared checklist of Missions' weapons:
1. Beef brisket -delicious, (lean or moist)
2. BBQ spareribs- shake the bone and the meat evacuates expeditiously.
3. Chicken, sausages and pulled pork - all are tasty, especially the sausages stuffed with jalapeno peppers.
4. Sides - mac-n-cheese, collards, coleslaw, fries, green beans and more are well prepared.
5. Sauces - 6 different flavors and I like them all.

The last few times we had to walk past Subway to get to our Chinese restaurant. The posters of the new sandwiches, and the smaller subs caught my eye!

It's been at least 2+ years, since the last visit to a Subway. I guess you can think of me as a sandwich snob, because I am particular on how a good sandwich should taste. 

Since my other half has been sick (since Friday), I decided to get him Sunday's special meatball sandwich.

I decided to try the new cheesy garlic steak sandwich, both 6 inches.

No disappointments coming from a sick guy, but mine was a lot more garlic tasting than I would even think of. I guess when I saw him spreading the garlic whipped mayo, should of been a sign.

I'll definitely be back to try the cute small sandwiches!"

Didn't say sorry for misunderstanding. Didn't try to make a customer happy. When I told him his customer service was lacking he just asked me what problem was. When I stated it was him and his bad service he told me to never come back. No problem there. In fact if your on the way there just visit the Lebanese place next door instead.

They were low on almost every size, which could explain the used box, but they could've let me know. The staff at the UPS store on Broadway and Campbell makes for a happier experience."

The spicy chicken sandwich was very filling (honestly one of the thickest chicken sandwiches we've seen). 

We were big fans of their blackened ranch. Pairs extremely well with the chicken tenders and their Cajun fries.

As New Orleans East continues revitalization projects, adding a Wal-Mart Super center is an asset to this community that offers suitable employment and allows money to stay in Orleans Parish. 

Wal-Mart is conveniently located off of I-10 at the Bullard Avenue exit. There is a large parking lot to accommodate high traffic volume during peak hours, easy access to RTA (Regional Transit Authority) for those who lack personal transportation, and has several fast food restaurants in the area.

I have been to several Wal-Mart stores around the country and this Bullard location has the most ANTI-THEFT locks on their products that I have ever seen for instance; perfume and cologne (forget about samples or taking advantage of this aisle before hitting the club or a hot date), condoms, at-home pregnancy tests, selected razors and cartridges, electronics, and other high-end merchandise. Surveillance cameras are visible in every department and on certain aisles with live recording in progress.
Security guards & NOPD patrol cars were seen in the store and parking lot. I appreciate the efforts in keeping the patrons feeling safe and prices low. 

The employees try to keep the property maintained by regularly attending to the restrooms, tidying up the departments throughout the day, and making sure the shopping carts are collected from the parking lot. Many of the employees greeted me as I passed. Nevertheless a great place for the One-Stop-Shop in the East!"

Five Guys is a fast-food burger chain which has won several awards in many local newspapers and it scores consistently high marks in user-rated forums as well.  

The burgers are juicy and hot, they make them to order, no heat lamps here!  Lots and lots of toppings including fried onions and jalapenos.  I had hot sauce, lettuce and pickles today.

The fries are incredible, and usually so hot that you might need to wait a minute or 2.  They do not peel the potatoes before cutting them, so many of them have skin on them, which lets you know that these are real potatoes.  They cook them in peanut oil, which gives them excellent flavor.  The smallest fries size you can get is so big you could share it with 3 people!

Love Five Guys, it leaves other chains far in the dust."

You have a variety of sauce to pair with your fish but I highly recommend the warm mango salsa.  The other entrées at Bonefish is either a hit or a miss with me.  Their daily specials can be very enticing but I usually end up wishing I'd order my usual instead.

The most recent time that I came in, I ordered a 3-pc chicken tenders and large fries. I waited for at least 10 minutes, and people who came after me continued getting orders while I still waited. Apparently the workers behind the counter hadn't ""dropped"" the tenders in the fryer as they were told when I placed my order. It took me a total of about 15-20 minutes to finally get all of my order with no apologies about long wait. This is a regular occurrence every time I frequent this Burger King. It always seems that so many items aren't ready despite there being many workers behind the counter.

My food quality overall was decent, although I have received cold chicken fries during previous experiences. This time, since I had waited so long for tenders to be ""dropped,"" they did seem to be fresh. 

I really wish this particular Burger King focused on fast food actually being fast. It would make it a much better experience. Additionally the environment of the restaurant needs to be cleaner."

So, when I do eat in my car, I'm more likely to choose based on the amount of mess rather than what sounds the most delicious.

Nevertheless, I wanted a quick breakfast, and Sonic was close to where I was running my errands, so I drove in.  The breakfast burrito with tater tots sounded great as well as having a low potential for mess.  I decided to forego the catsup and salsa, but still enjoyed my meal.

Turns out only one person working. I was just there for a basic oil change thought it would be quick in and out. Wasn't the case. This guy was more interested in adding services on, convinced me to go synthetic. That's fine if I'm getting good work but to pay extra for horrible service is why this gets a one star. It took a whole hour and change to get the oil change. They vacuum the inside and check the air in your tires and other things to make it look like they are working. During my next oil change the mechanic told me the guy that did this oil change stripped the pan and I would need to get the oil pan replaced sometime. I told him I wasn't surprised since the guy at jiffy lube didn't know what he was doing. Also the tire pressure caps were all loose and one was missing. All this annoying because I figured I paid extra I would be getting better service. Not the case. 

If you go to this jiffy lube beware of Antoine M. He doesn't know what he's doing and is only interested in upcharging. Ended up spending $73 for horrible service.

some tips for wawa virgins like moi (although i doubt any of you locals are):
  * you use a fancy touchscreen computer to order. even old people can do it (i saw it with my own eyes), so don't be afraid!
  * there are indeed cups for soda by the soda machine. do not use the brown cups--those are for coffee and will confuse the person ringing you up.

Here I again.  Broad Street is interesting in this area because of gentrification going on in the area so I'm going to be nice but honest.

There were about ten people behind the counter and it appeared as though I was being ignored for almost minute.  Then Gasselle approached me I guess trying to smile to no avail.  Maybe because I asked if they were still serving breakfast.

I ordered the COMBO Son of Baconator, which has a small drink and drink.  I asked about the bathroom and she said she would buzz me in.  I went back and accidentally went right instead of left and when I looked back for Gasselle she was gone.  Another employee bussed me in, I guess there is a 15 or 30 second delay on the lock.

I heard mix reviews about Anthony's from a few different friends.  One friend said it was the best she had, while another said she had too high of expectations.  I find myself right in the middle based on location and quality.

We ordered the small classic Italian salad and the Paulie's Pie.  The small is plenty of salad for 2, maybe even 3 people if you just want something refreshing before eating a heavy pizza.  The Paulie's Pie consists of meatballs, sausage, hot or sweet peppers & ricotta cheese.  We went with the long hots because why not!?  It added the right amount of tanginess, but if it is still too much for you its easy to take off the top.  Overall the pizza was great in size, taste, and quality.  Very surprised considering this is a chain restaurant.

This place has easy parking since it is within a shopping center off of Lancaster Ave.  It was MUCH louder inside than I expected.

She then charged me to tape up the 3 boxes, telling me that it was to keep ""people from abusing the system."" *Blank stare* The proper customer service etiquette would have been for her to tell me that since I haven't paid in the past, she wouldn't charge me this time, but in the future, the boxes need to be taped up or there would be a charge. But clearly Jennifer is not familiar with customer service or kindness to her patrons. Last time going there. I don't give money to those who are unkind and don't appreciate their customers. It only takes one time, Jennifer."

We got our drinks only for someone to never return to ask if we needed refills. It took another 20min just to get breadsticks. If we needed anything we had to walk to the counter and ask the employees, who were standing around and one of them was eating a salad, to get us something. 

Every table had the same issues. They were not busy the service is just terrible because the employees are lazy. There were 6 employees on staff that we saw and not a single one did anything but stand around and chat. This will be our last time visiting as we always have a problem here."

They give you tons of chicken as well. Very kid friendly and love the atmosphere. Love the fact that they are costumer oriented and they serve you. Not only great yummy food (not really healthy wink wink) but they give you a great experience. It makes having two kids a whole lot easier when we do go here. Clean play area for kiddos and helpful staff. My pleasure is always the thing you hear last from each and everyone who works there. I also love the fact that they are not open on Sunday. Although I seem to always want chic fil a on Sunday. They not only serve yummy food but they as a company serve God.

The service has always been good. The staff is friendly. My issue was with the food quality.

For Christmas I received a $50 giftcard from my employer. So I figured I'd give my old favorite another try. I was in the area tonight and decided to stop in with my boyfriend. Again, the service was flawless. I was disappointed the Shanghai Cucumbers were removed from the menu. But I won't deduct a star for that. They had some new additions to the menu, again. I decided to try the Wok Charred Brussels Sprouts and the Long Life Noodles (Side). The Sprouts were cooked well. They were topped with cilantro which added a nice freshness. The Noodles were tossed with garlic and scallions. They had a great smokey flavor. Overall, I was happy with tonight's dining experience. Plus one star."

I went in for a Brazillian before a vacation and was really excited. The pain was tolerable, the waxer was nice...everything was fine. I got home and noticed she had missed a few spots. Kind of annoying, but she's human, so I called and asked if I could come in for a touch-up.

I came in the following day for said touch up and was with a new waxer, which is no big deal. We were having a casual conversation while she was waxing me (which is nice when someone is REAL intimately up in your business) and then she dropped some comment along the lines about how things are hard for ""us big girls.""

Uh. Excuse me. First of all, this person had at least 50 pounds on me easily. Second of all, I've struggled with body image my entire life and the last thing I need is for someone I am paying to insult me without being prompted. Third, there's gotta be a pretty significant sense of trust with the vulnerability that comes with being waxed in this way, and when someone essentially calls you fat with your literal butthole in their face, it's pretty crushing.

(It is not pre-measured and waiting to be used).  All subs served with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, oil and vinegar. You can order a Mini sub that is 5"" long, a regular is 7"" and a giant is 14"" -- the husband and I settled on splitting a regular ""Jersey Shore's Favorite"" --- provolone, ham and cappacuolo. It was delicious! They also have warm subs as well as wraps.

There were many issues:
====================
* No melted butter, it was a lobster salad.  Okay, that's a style, but I like it second best.
* The Lobster salad was made with cheap salad dressing, not mayo.
* The lobster salad had chopped onion, and a lot of it.  Huh?
* The lobster texture not good, tough, and was from frozen.
* The lobster was chilled.
* No fries.  Pffffttt.
* The roll was impossible to pick up -- too much sauce and basically, an open faced sandwich.
* In the end, totally not what I had in mind.

The waitress/bartender never came by my area after she delivered the sandwich, and before I finished it.  Why?  Was she afraid if she asks ""Is everything okay"", she would get an answer she only expected?

I asked for the bill, and saw the lobster roll was on the receipt for $26.25.  Huh?  I asked to see the menu again, pointed to the $18.99 item, and was told she didn't give me that one, it was in another section.  Terrible sandwich, terrible price that put me over my breakfast expense limit.

Decor is awesome, the place is well laid out, and they always have some good tunes playing.

Ok, so my only gripe, is how these bastards don't mind a HUGE spoon of rice and beans but then they go in with the tongs and shake out half the meat!! WTF! don't skimp on the best part!

Nothing distinguishes them much from the competition - they carry the usual array of toiletries, cosmetics, OTC medications, cleaning supplies, foodstuffs, housewares, gizmos, and gadgets, have a full-service pharmacy, and provide photo processing, just as you'd find anywhere else. What differentiates this particular store from most others is the utter lack of service. How does it not occur to the single and somewhat inept cashier staring at a gradually lengthening line of customers to call for assistance? Why does the manager open another register grudgingly, all the while mumbling under her breath, when she's made aware of the situation up front? It's late Saturday morning, a steady stream of people are coming through the door, and it appears these are the only two on duty. One is frustrated - lack of training? panic under pressure? - the other is upset she has to work while her coffee is getting cold in the break room. So sorry to disturb you, ladies . . .

Our order: farmhouse hash ($12), millionaire bacon ($5.50), avocado toast ($11), Purple haze drink ($5)

The second time we came, we got the oatmeal with fruit and the breakfast burger. 

Pros:
- THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS. I don't know if the FL brunch scene just knocks CA's brunch scene out of the water or what - but the food was straight up delicious. I would say we liked our order the FIRST time better than the second, but all of it was super super delicious. The purple haze was so good I had to get it the second time as well - just delicious lavender goodness. They don't come off as a chain restaurant but they are! That super surprised me.
- The millionaire bacon was delicious - might seem dumb to pay $5 for 4 pieces of bacon, but it was super good. And I'm usually not a big bacon person. Avocado toast seems dumb to also pay $11 - but it was WORTH it. they are not stingy with the avos at all.
- Not a super long wait during brunch on a weekday!
- Easy parking lot
- Lots of sitting options
- Pretty fast service, I don't remember anyone being not courteous
- Pretty clean during covid season

Cons:
- Honestly, none. Please come to California !!"

Each had been told 20 minute waits but all had been there over an hour. When they told me 7:30 I was happy to leave and come back rather than wait. Only problem was at 7:30 the meds were not ready and they told me 15 more minutes. It was over an hour before they had it done.

This is the new guard, throwing caution to the wind and letting the flavors and techniques of Chinese cooking create something new, exciting, and a bit more approachable for the American palate.

My new favorite way to dine at P.F. Chang's? Appetizers and drinks at the bar. 

""Hunan"" Dragon Wings... Huge, plump, juicy, perfectly crispy wings (I'm guessing corn starch) lightly coated in a deliciously spicy, sweet, and tangy sauce. They're served with a side of perfectly pickled cucumbers that are the ideal foil for the sauce. I think there are 10 in an order, and I can eat 5 before I realize what I did, and then the other 5 just disappear! 

P.F. Chang's Sushi... I know what you're thinking. Sushi? Really? YES! I can't say it's the best, but it's passable, and the combos are tasty and worth a try. I've had these rolls a few times, and my qualm is that the rice can be a little gummy and under seasoned. Maybe they press too hard when they make em? 

On the list to try in the future... Northern Style Dry Ribs, Vietnamese Salad (thanks Robert S), and quite a few other appetizer items! 

Thanks P.F. Chang's for being a damned good and consistent. I so appreciate it!"

This review is about the above and beyond amazing customer service. I'm lactose intolerant so I ordered a burger without cheese. When I received my order, I noticed they accidentally added cheese to my burger. No big deal, I just brought it up to the counter and explained my situation. After apologizing profusely, they vowed to make another one. Something must have gotten lost in the mix because ten minutes later, my burger wasn't ready. The manager ran over to me, almost exasperated with about a thousand apologies. Things happen, I wasn't really that upset. I got a speedy new burger, more fries, and a coupon for a free meal at a later time. 

So they messed up my burger and when they remade it, it got lost. This could easily have resulted in a negative review. It was the incredible customer service and genuine caring that I really appreciated."

I do wish the store associates would spend more time handling the animals so they're not so afraid of humans.

The staff seem very friendly and nice for the most part but got defensive when I mentioned spending more time with the pets.  Some staff seem more knowledgeable than others.

I wasn't sure if she was actually taking the order but I doubled checked it as I walked away and it was correct. She was also super confused when I ordered a ""skinny mocha"" but I noticed afterwards it was not listed on the menu at this location (I've seen it on more than one menu board up here).

Coffee, please. And, that spicy omelet with avocado on top, while you're at it. Extra plate for sharing, too. Easily done. It arrived with second plate in a few minutes. Surprisingly good, especially the unexpected BBQ brisket sticking out both ends that added a savory chew to the otherwise soft melty dish. The three pancake side was more than enough to split after spreading on butter and a combination of table syrups. Glad we had only one platter, because we were challenged finishing it.

As I have been to multiple locations in my travels a few things are always consistant at PF Chang's - the terrific service and good food. Tonight was no exception. 

Had a few Kirin beers to start off and then went right for the food. Oh, those wonderful lettuce wraps. Great chicken and spicy sauces to spread on them that our waitress mixed for us. Seared ahi tuna over a bed of mixed greens was also delish. As entrees we ordered the crispy honey shrimp and the mu shu chicken. Both were delectable, and our waitress set up the mu shu wraps for us which is a good thing as I would have made a mess of it.

Healthy eating, no, but way good!

The decor of the place is upscale faux Asian, and I always think it will be expensive to eat here, but the overall bill is never too harsh. Lots of plates in the $10 - $20 range. Good beer and drink list. Yeah, it's a chain, but the food and experience is enjoyable."

On Saturday afternoon, we had nine hungry girls and no reservations, which made Bakersfield the perfect option since they take walk-ins only. We didn't have to wait long for a table large enough to fit our group to open up, but we did have to wait until our whole party was there to even put our name in for a table.

Once our name was in, we migrated to the nearby bar to get drinks. The hostess was on us every ten seconds to move out of the way, which we gladly did, once we received our drinks. It was a little weird and made ordering kind of awkward since we knew this woman just wanted us to get out of the way. But how else would we have ordered drinks? 

Seated at the table, things ran much smoother. Our server was awesome and made some great recommendations. The queso and guac were both delicious and came out seconds after we ordered them. The tacos were also great and I found two to be more than enough after the chip bonanza. Also, the margaritas were on point.

So, I hired a handyman to build a small side latch fence on my house and he had me type out everything I needed to go and buy for him to build the fence. I had no idea what I was looking at (the list) but I had it in my phone and hoped there would be help in the lumber area to get me through my list. With social distancing I really was not confident I'd get the help I needed one on one. I got a cart and walked to the lumber area and approached a man named Rey and told him my situation. Well, he personally got every single item I needed and he knew it was for a fence so he was going through the wood to make sure I got very good pieces, he explained everything as we went, marked everything for me that he cut and the whole time my daughter and I were saying, 'I wish this guy was building the fence'. 
I think Rey really knows his stuff and has built decks for sure, maybe even house construction. When I need help at Home Depot, I will always ask for Rey and hope he is working.

This restaurant has its own parking lot with convenient access from two side streets.

The place is new and clean, so there are no obvious maintenance issues yet. Service is good, although they are still a bit inconsistent with the amount of coleslaw they dish out. Sometimes you get a lot, sometimes you get less. I haven't tried their Taco Bell offerings but their Long John Silver's fried fish and hushpuppies are up to standard. As a plus, since Taco Bell is the co-brand, you get to try all the varieties of Taco Bell sauces on your fish and fries."

1. Pull to the order speaker
2. Immediately welcomed
3 Start speak your order only be interrupted by the speaker blasting ""wait a second!""
4. After an awkward  moment the speaker blasts ""Go ahead what do want?""
5. You order a sausage biscuit and a small coffee.
6. The speaker says ""pull forward""
7. Pull forward to the pay window where you are met by three employees holding a handful of receipts that ask ""What did you order? "" before you can answer the window shuts almost on your hand which is holding the cash for your order
8. They then open the window spout out a mumbled total and rip the money from your fingers. 
9. Here is where it gets fun; they give you back your change wadded up in a receipt and the window slams shut again.
10. You then pull forward to the next window where you sit and aren't greeted at all for a few moments.
11. Then, wait for it, one or two employees with headsets on ask "" What did you order?""
12. Now that window slam shut and you wait for another few awkward moments before your order is slung at you with a taped receipt with a sticker that proclaims something  about being double checked accuracy(lies) lol!
13. Finally, you drive away and begin to consume the breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll that you never ordered.


Other than those 13 points great experience!"

A much better restaurant is deserving of this prime location and this place would be better served next to some other fast food places.  I really could do without the steel cage basket they serve things in.  Maybe this place will do ok as there isn't any other fast food joint within eye shot of this place other than Subway but I think a local joint would have done better business and fit in much better with the neighborhood.  Personally I could do without it and probably won't be back as there are much better burgers for a similar price nearby in the bars.  I guess this would be a good spot to bring kids.

My boyfriend and I parked in a metered spot hoping to get a table, but no luck. We ordered anyway and decided to get the food to go. The cashier was super friendly; he made recommendations when he saw us staring at the menu in bewilderment. ""First time?"" he said. Yes indeed. We ended up ordering single smoke shack burgers based on the cashier's recommendation. The food smelled so good that we sat in the car and ate. We didn't want to ruin the flavor by getting all the way home and having to reheat our meal. The cherry peppers were a bit too hot for me but my boyfriend loved the flavor.  We also got an order of cheese fries. Seriously so good although they do look like Ore Ida as other reviewers have mentioned. So the great thing about eating in a metered spot is that when you still have an hour left on the meter you can head back for dessert. Because we're greedy (thank God we work out) we went back and ordered half concretes. My boyfriend got bananas and peanut butter sauce mix-ins. I ordered the Liberty Shell, a mix of canoli, chocolate, lemon ricotta and strawberry puree. He loved his. I thought mine needed more strawberry puree but it was yummy nonetheless. So the question of whether fast food places like this get a 3 vs 4 from us is always ""would we return?""  The answer is a 4/5 for shake shack. I just wish they had more seating available."

I started with an appetizer of Steakhouse mac. Can you mess up fried mac 'n' cheese? Yup, they found a way. The batter was okay, but the interior was reminiscent of the disgusting macaroni and cheese that comes in a box with fake powdered cheese.

The entrees. Sheesh! Could you really go wrong with steak medallions in garlic butter? Apparently you can. Despite the appearance of the word ""steak"" in the name Outback Steakhouse, the steak was horrible! In fact, this is the first time in my life I've ever eaten a cold steak. COLD! STEAK! And the quality? Yuck! I think they took the most deplorable meat on the planet, maybe McDonald's hamburger patties, and chopped them into medallions. That's how bad the quality was. What they claimed was garlic butter added absolutely no flavor to the steak. The dish was completely flavorless and the meat was tough and filled with gristle. Maybe the worst cut of meat I've ever eaten?

The french fries were unappetizing, luke warm and occasionally burnt. Again, how do you mess up french fries? The loaded mashed potatoes? Yikes! These were topped with rock-hard, stale, imitation bacon bits, not real bacon, and utterly flavorless cheese.

Basically, this Outback is selling horrendous food at inflated prices, and apparently there are enough suckers in Cool Springs to keep them afloat. There are so many amazing places to eat within minutes of Outback, you'd have to be out of your mind to eat here."

This establishment is an absolute joke. They are extremely unprofessional & inadequate employees. The first time I went to get my food they screwed up the order completely.

The 2nd Time was an absolute mess! My order was placed at 7pm, I arrived there at 7:20 they said I ordered at another pizza hut because they had no record of my call or order. I leave to try and ""find"" the ""right ""pizza hut and come to find out 10 minutes later it is at that very Pizza Hut that I originally went to. So after getting off the phone with the guy at Pizza Hut I return by 7:30. When I get there I pay for my pizza and they tell me that it will be another 10-15 minutes until my pizza done.

my suggestion is to take a half day off work to use this post office, so that you have enough time to complete your transaction. or, go to 30th street. if you do use this post office make sure you have everything correct before getting in line. nothing worse than getting to the front of the line only to be told you filled out the wrong customs form, at which point you can a) fill it out the new form on the spot and piss everyone off behind you, or b) go to the back of the line and start over.

if you just need stamps, go to CVS.

The turkey egg and cheese on flatbread tasted like it tastes at any Dunkins ... not great and perhaps a touch under good but that's what you get with pre-fab.

It took several calls but finally had someone look at my vehicle and stated would get back to me. It is now 40 days later and was just told they are denying the claim. The person stated that even though the shop has a lift that is the same color that matches the paint left on my car and is the same size as the damage, I am told THAT lift was not used but a different one. I am now in the process of disputing the denial but not sure how long that will take. I would NOT recommend this shop and would avoid at all costs.

Update:
Thanks Jennifer for the reply. However, you just told the Claims person who denied the claim (and I have spoke to many times) to call me. No help whatsoever."

Expect only one cashier to be open no matter how many are in line and the shelves to be under stocked or empty. The store appears to be under-staffed at all times of the day. When roaming the aisles it's hard to find an associate to ask for help.

Slow to seat (I've seen folks walk out), slow to bring food, sometimes we have to wait to have .  That being said my personal experience with this IHOP location (which is limited to like maybe 2 times a year) is that all of the other experiences are decent.

I actually think the dining area is clean but we normally go between 10am-1pm.  We don't go there late at night.

Servers I have interacted with have always been polite although some are definitely brighter than others.  But I have never had a wrong order, attitude, or been left too long without being asked for refills or the like.

Most importantly, the food has always been IHOP level decent.  I applaud IHOP in general for expanding the coffee/hot cocoa offerings as that is my drink of choice.  I also applaud the increased healthier food options.

IHOP is in my mom's top 5 places to eat so it is nice to know that there is a reliable location out there.  Fortunately, when I am hanging with her time is not a factor."

She didn't want to give me a tray so I could get my soda, ketchup, etc while waiting for my food. Then she asked me, and I kid you not, whether I ""expected"" her to ""go all the way back to the counter"" to get my food to put on the tray I'd prepared instead of grabbing a second tray for the food. She literally didn't want to walk one step to the food counter, a difference of about one foot of space. At that point I just laughed at her unbelievably terrible attitude. Also, the store is filthy.

My experience here was almost the opposite and dare I say the worst in all of the Panera stores?

Came on a Saturday and the line was extremely disorderly. I didn't know where I was supposed to order and people were just standing everywhere.
- Broccoli Mac and Cheese - Solid mac and cheese but there was barely anything in the bowl. Definitely not worth the $5 I paid for.
- Thai Chicken Salad - Very standard. One of the better dishes on the menu in my opinion because of the yummy sauce.
In my recollection, ordering the Two for Two they give you the option of choosing bread, apple, or chips but they didn't ask me at all and just gave me the bread.

The inside of the store is a hot mess - the seating area is incredibly jumbled and the signs are barely there to say where to sit. When the waiters were wiping down the tables, they only wiped down the tables very briefly without wiping down the seats or anything else. There was no Wi-Fi in the shop and also the lights kept turning off like the place lost electricity.

Anyway I go to this Waffle House after a late movie on a Saturday - we walk in, it smells like cherry bathroom freshener with extra mothball flavor, and we sit down at a booth near the greasy grill. Yum, grease, I think. Hash browns.

This is the cliche part. The wisecracking older harried leathery waitress and the younger soon to be leathery completely disinterested waitress completely ignored us for a good 10 minutes while some depressed trucker looking dude slowly sipped coffee at the counter and some young guy scraped grease off the grill.

Nothing on the menu looked good, even the waffles, and the smell blasted out all other senses except the spidey one, and I suddenly announced that if we stayed there one more second I was sure we were never going to be allowed to leave because this had to be a gateway to hell or at least purgatory.

My experience was through the drive through. I had just got in line and ordered right away. There was no wait to order which was nice I thought. Well, I spoke to soon. I inched up behind the next vehicle giving the car behind me enough room to order. 

As I sat there I was looking around the parking lot, the clock, even the staff. After about 10 minutes of not moving with four cars in front of me, it made me think 'oh they must have messed an order up and are trying to fix it they will be done soon'. 

13 minutes go by and a staff is at the second car in line behind the first handing them their order of food. I thought the line was going to start moving. Well the second car left and we inched up. 

Finally, after 17 minutes of waiting I decided since those other three cars are still sitting here I might as well not waste anymore of my time.

The prices are ok but look for clearance items at the ends  of the aisles. I have picked up some nice rugs, Christmas lights. garden chairs and accent pillows on clearance for great prices. 

There is a good selection of grills, mowers, snowblowers. You will also find kits for building sheds and supplies for fencing.

Sonic is available only at one location back home in SoCal - never even knew that until I moved to Nashville. I have friends back home, who will drive a good 45 minutes to enjoy Sonic. 

Personally I don't know that I would frequent Sonic if it weren't parked on nearly every corner in Nashville but I do find myself choosing it when we are out for something fast, over other ""american"" fast food chains. 

Definitely a step-up from the normal fast food joints, the burgers are hearty, I have never been disappointed with one to date. They are pretty straight forward, burgers, fries, fried foods, hot dogs and other unhealthy american eats (save for the grilled chicken wrap which is a bit healthier if you forgo the sauces). 

What honestly makes Sonic good is the drink and dessert selections! Limeades, floats, milkshakes, sundaes, fresh fruit slushes - for treats this is the where its at and at great prices! 

Recently Sonic added some hot dogs to the menu for only $1.99, each loaded with different ingredients ie; Chicago Dog, Chili Dog, etc. I have tried 3 of them and while I am not a huge hot dog fan, this is a great late night or lunch choice with one of their specialty drinks or milkshakes - each of the variations I tried were tasty. 

There may not be anything life changing about their food, but they are definitely worth a trip and their quality is a step above other fast food places. The seasonal items and specialty menu changes are something to try too!"

A few of the toppings I requested aren't part of Five Guys's complimentary toppings, and upped the bill accordingly. The grand total? $16.[1] It was worth every penny. Next time you visit Five Guys, ask for the Dave H. special, and don't be surprised if you get strange looks.

  It's either you hired a bunch of lazy employees that take their hourly wage and do absolutely nothing to deserve it... or the problem is within your company training. Corporate should clean house within this Walmart cause this is ridiculous.

I don't really see a point in reviewing a big franchise giant like Chili's, but I'll do it anyway.  I had bad experiences in a different Chili's in Virginia, which I never want to speak of again.  But I really enjoyed my lunch trip here.  My bf and I got the Chicken enchilada soup and I got the Broccoli and Cheddar soup.  It was very creamy with a good flavor.  The lunch special also came with chips and salsa and garlic bread.  It was a very good lunch deal.  The wait staff was very nice and I would come back again.

This morning was the final straw. There is a guy working behind the counter, don't know his name, a bit on the tall side with dark hair. He is there most mornings. Every time i order, he tries to up-sell. Although I understand why businesses do this, i also understand the concept of buying more usually means a lower per-unit cost. So, if i want more i will ask for more and take advantage of the lower per-unit cost. 

However, this guys doesn't just suggest you buy more he insists upon it and wont take no for an answer. He pushes saying.. ""you buy one more.. cheaper"". I say, ""i don't need more, just give me what i ordered please"" because overall, buying more than I need costs me more. As mentioned above, the per-unit cost is just lower. He then continues to insist util i need to demand that he just give me what i ordered. 

Here's a tip for you Dunkin' Donuts at 3001 West Germantown Pike, try and be curious and respectful to your customers. Because without us, you are out of business!

I will now go out of my way to another Dunkin' Donuts to avoid this guy and his agressive ""greedy"" selling tactics."

I have here for event and also come here to eat in person. I like their chef because they paid attention to the detail for the food. We started with the mussel in white wine butter sauce. The mussels was clean and not have any sand particle. The chef has good skill to cook this dish that the mussel meat just tender and soft. I have seen many chef has over cook the mussel but the here is very good touch. 

The entrée are 6 oz sirloin and the shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka. This sirloin was well prepared to the temperature I have ordered. The seafood linguine was well prepared. I like the large shrimp and large sea scallops. Good selection on the material. The dish make excellent mark."

First, let me say that the customer service is excellent. Everybody here is as friendly and accommodating as possible. Props to Annie, who is really easy to work with and has a lot of great suggestions. The line at this office also moves quickly, thanks to the fact that the people who work here are bona fide pros. 

Unfortunately, this office is very difficult to follow, and the way the parking lot is structured is unintuitive. I am also an expert at evaluating the accessibility of buildings and parking lots, and I found that there were several ADA accessibility violations in the building and parking lot, which is terrible considering that it is a federal building. 

I would avoid going here if you have a physical disability and need to go to the post office. 

In addition to that, they do not do a good job keeping a diverse number of mailing envelopes here. The first time I came here 3 weeks ago, they were out of most of the mailers.

We were a small group celebrating a new member of the firm. Staff put a few tables together for us, giving us complete command of the main dining room late in the afternoon. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers and smoozed for a couple of hours. We had good conversation as we consumed a plate of hummus/pita, sweet potato fries w dipping sauces and roasted Brussel sprouts in balsamic (?) dressing. 

The drinks were fine, if unimaginative; the same being true for the food. We consumed everything with a couple rounds of booze, and had no complaints, but it could have been so much more to keep us interested in their dark auburn atmosphere.

This Iron Hill just felt tired compared to other of their siblings I have visited and enjoyed. They occupy a key corner in town and it was easy to imagine how much more interesting and inviting it could be. How about an outdoor presence like everyone else? How about better marking of the main entrance door? How about better lighting around the bar to accentuate the back bar display?

He apologized and took my steak back and then the manager came out and apologized and they brought a second steak about 10 minutes later. That steak was seared on one side and just completely raw the rest of the way. At this point we decided to leave and the manger came to apologize and even gave us 2 $20 gift cards and asked us to come back after the holidays and they would make it up to us.

So, we did, and we ordered the same meal again. This time the fish was dry but not as bad, and my steak was still over cooked, but not as bad so we kept our meals and didn't say anything.

The lights were way too low, and they wouldn't turn them up. I couldn't even read the menu where we were sitting, and I had to get up and read the menu by the hostess' podium light. The music was crummy tennybopper pop junk, not suitable for dining, and wayyyy too loud. They wouldn't turn the bad music down, even though it was either killing conversation, or making people shout at each other. The servers are inattentive at best. The black napkins are not washed well, kind of stinky. This is about the bottom of the barrel for pretentious overpriced chain restaurants. The more well known Australian themed chain restaurant on the other side of the parking lot is considerably better."

---

Brand new Jersey Mike's location near the Giant superstore. Beautifully clean interior and food that lives up to the chain's standard of the freshly sliced cold cut subs as well as a variety of hot subs. Both my wife and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with a side of marinara sauce and we're thoroughly happy with the order. 

Only a couple reasons why this is four stars:
1) The wait time was tremendous despite a huge number of staff behind the line. I imagine this is just a factor of being newly opened and they'll figure out how to speed the process as time goes on. 
2) Online ordering was not yet available. I believe they have this in other locations, so maybe it will be up by the next time we go back. 

As the above changes, this will definitely be a 5-star location!"

The lady who provided me with my order, offered some sauces. She was not cheap with what she gave us, we had plenty of sauces. Which is usually an issue for us. Everything was perfect, I can't wait to get to use the drive-through again one day!"

Fast forward to the next day: I'm stranded on the side of the road & got towed to a mechanic where we learned that my car had been double filled with oil. Jiffy Lube did not remove the dirty oil from my car before adding more - causing lasting damage to my vehicle. My catalytic converter is being replaced, along with my spark plugs and other hardware, because of Jiffy Lube's negligence.

Worst of all - when I followed up with Jiffy Lube about the lasting damage my car sustained, the director of guest services implied that I was lying about the whole thing and denied my claim, despite having documented proof from two separate mechanical shops pointing to oil contamination as the direct cause of my car problems. I'm deeply offended by this accusation. I will never be back to Jiffy Lube again & frankly wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy."

You are not alone. Yes, the steak is delicious...but this carb queen's main motivation for coming here is the rolls and honey butter. There, I've said it.

Second to the rolls, however, is their steak. I ordered an 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and a caesar salad on the side. I ordered my steak medium and that's exactly how it came out - a pretty pink center and perfectly cooked outside. I loved the mashed potatoes and will definitely order these again (like I mentioned earlier, CARBS). The caesar salad was good, but I would probably opt for a mixed greens salad instead next time. Overall, I was stuffed at the end of this meal AND still had a good amount to take home with me for the next day.

I really like the atmosphere in here. It's exactly what you would expect that vibe of somewhere called ""Texas Roadhouse"" to be--loud country music, western decor, and just an overall friendly and relaxed vibe. A wonderful dining out experience with good food in an atmosphere that doesn't make you feel ashamed for accidentally putting your elbows on the table or reclining in your booth after stuffing your face with rolls. Service was also friendly and timely (we did come here at like 9:30 at night, so it was probably past their diner rush). Overall, awesome experience! This might become a frequent stop for me...just not too frequent because you know, those rolls."

My provider has an arrangement with UPS wherein you take in equipment to be returned with your account number, and UPS handles the shipping -- no cost to you.

You don't package it. Just take it to UPS.

Sounds too easy. But it was, and it worked. I took in the receiver yesterday late afternoon. With just my account number, the very friendly clerk pulled up my name, address and the serial number of the receiver being returned. Absolutely amazing!

He gave me a receipt and advised me to retain it until I had confirmation that the equipment had been received.

In fact I've yet to find a great place to get fried chicken in Reno! When is Churches Chicken? Where is Popeye's? Where is Williams Chicken (aka Ghetto Chicken)

I ordered catering from this Tijuana flats for my sister's birthday fiesta & it worked out beautifully. I ordered the taco bar option for 16 people for around $180 total! 
When we arrived to pick up the order it was given to us in an insulated bag and the very helpful employee explained to my husband how to set up the sternos provided with our order. They also included serving ware, plastic silverware, plates & a bottle of hot sauce!! A huge bang for our buck while also being delicious! I wish I would have had time to snap a picture but it was a busy night! 
Our order included chicken & beef. Both hard & soft taco shells, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, queso, shredded cheese, chopped onions & tomatoes!! Plenty for our guests to enjoy and personalize their meals! And as always service with a smile!"

I was having a bad day and the lasting I thought would happen to me would be the rudeness coming off this staff member there was no ""hi how are you"" or ""what can I help you with"" he said ""ya well you can pack it Im busy right now"" he wasn't he went to chat with another staff member and laugh while I needed help cause I didn't know what to do. I almost want to work there to cheer people up cause the people that work there need an attitude upgrade !"
